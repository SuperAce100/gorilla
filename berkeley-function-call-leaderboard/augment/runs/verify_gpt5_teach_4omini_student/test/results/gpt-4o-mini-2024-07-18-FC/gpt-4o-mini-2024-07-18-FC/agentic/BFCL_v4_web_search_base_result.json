Less than half of all countries count a billionaire among their citizens. A fifth of those that do have just one.\\nThis year, 78 nations and semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire on the list, the same number as last year. The richest member of any country is Tesla cofounder and CEO\\nElon Musk\\n(estimated net worth: $342 billion), who was born a dual citizen of South Africa and Canada but obtained American citizenship in 2002 and has counted the United States as his primary residence ever since. Among mainland China\\u2019s 450 billionaires, the richest is\\nZhang Yiming\\n($65.5 billion), cofounder of TikTok parent ByteDance. India\\u2019s wealthiest is\\nMukesh Ambani\\n($92.5 billion), who chairs Reliance Industries, the multinational conglomerate founded by his late father.\\nThe U.S. dominates the top of the ranking, with only two non-Americans in\\nthe \\u201c$100 Billion Club.\\u201d\\nOne is\\nAmancio Ortega\\n($124 billion), the richest person in Spain and cofounder of the retailer Inditex, known for the Zara fast fashion brand. The other is\\nBernard Arnault\\n($178 billion), the wealthiest in France, whose fashion and cosmetics empire LVMH includes the likes of Louis Vuitton and Sephora.\\nThree countries have joined or rejoined since last year: Albania and Peru, which have one billionaire each, and Saudi Arabia,\\nwhere\\nForbes\\nidentified 14 new billionaires and one returnee\\n. The Saudi fortunes stem from a wide range of sources, from banking to pharmaceuticals to broadcasting. The richest is that of investor\\nPrince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud\\n($16.5 billion). Peru\\u2019s richest person,\\nEduardo Hochschild\\n($2.4 billion), returns to the list this year thanks to the rising share price of his mining company, while Albania has its first-ever billionaire:\\nSamir Mane\\n($1.4 billion), who created the country\\u2019s largest supermarket and retail electronics chains.\\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh, Panama and Uruguay no longer have any billionaires.\\nMuhammed Aziz Khan\\n($1.1 billion), who chairs the Bangladeshi energy company Summit Group, has been living in Singapore and finally transferred his citizenship there (the city-state doesn\\u2019t allow dual citizenship). He\\u2019s not the wealthiest of his new nationality, though\\u2014that title belongs to the paint manufacturing entrepreneur\\nGoh Cheng Liang\\n($13 billion). Meanwhile,\\nForbes\\nhas recategorized the assets of Panama\\u2019s Stanley Motta as a family fortune in light of new information, so the banking investor is no longer considered an individual billionaire. And Uruguay\\u2019s Andr\\u00e9s Bzurovski Bay and Sergio Fogel have fallen below the three-comma mark thanks to the dropping share price of their fintech startup dLocal.\\nThe Asia-Pacific region had the most billionaire citizens in 2024, but this year its 1,052 ranking members put it just behind the Americas, which have 1,077, led by 902 in the U.S. After that comes Europe (772) and the Middle East & Africa (127).\\nHere is the richest billionaire of each country and semi-autonomous region on the 2025\\nWorld\\u2019s Billionaires list\\n.\\nDATA AS OF MARCH 7, 2025.\\nAlbania\\nRichest

It competes in\\nLigue 1\\n, the top tier of\\nFrench football\\n, and plays its home matches at the\\nRoazhon Park\\n. The team's president is Olivier Cloarec, and its owner is\\nArt\\u00e9mis\\n, the holding company of businessman\\nFran\\u00e7ois Pinault\\n.\\nRennes was founded in 1901 under the name Stade Rennais and is one of the\\nfounding members\\nof the first division of French football. Alongside\\nNantes\\n, Rennes is one of the top football clubs in the region and the two are among the main clubs that contest the\\nDerby Breton\\n. The club's best finish in the league has been third, accomplishing this feat after the season was ended prematurely in\\n2019\\u201320\\n. Rennes has won three\\nCoupe de France\\ntitles in\\n1965\\n,\\n1971\\nand\\n2019\\n. After winning the Coupe de France in 1971, Rennes changed its name to its current version, but the club's home colours have been the same since its inception, which are red, black, and white.\\nRennes is known for its youth academy, known in English as the\\nHenri Gu\\u00e9rin\\nTraining Centre, which was formed in 2000. In 2010, the\\nFrench Football Federation\\n(FFF) recognised Rennes as having the best youth academy in the country.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nThe cornerstone of the academy is the under-19 team, which has won the\\nCoupe Gambardella\\nthree times in 1973, 2003 and 2008. The academy has produced several notable talents, such as\\nOusmane Demb\\u00e9l\\u00e9\\n,\\nYacine Brahimi\\n,\\nEduardo Camavinga\\n,\\nYoann Gourcuff\\n,\\nYann M'Vila\\n,\\nMoussa Sow\\n,\\nAbdoulaye Doucour\\u00e9\\n,\\nSylvain Wiltord\\n,\\nJimmy Briand\\n,\\nD\\u00e9sir\\u00e9 Dou\\u00e9\\nand\\nMathys Tel\\n.\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nHistory of Stade Rennais FC\\nStade Rennais in 1904\\nStade Rennais Football Club was founded on 10 March 1901 by a group of former students living in\\nBrittany\\n. Football had quickly become widely circulated in nearby regions and it was soon brought to Brittany. The club's first match was played two weeks later against FC Rennais, which Stade lost 6\\u20130.\\nIn 1902, Stade Rennais joined the\\nUSFSA\\nfederation and, subsequently, became a founding member of the Ligue de Bretagne de football, a newly created regional league founded by the federation. In the second league season, the club won the competition after defeating the inaugural league winners FC Rennais 4\\u20130 in the final.\\nOn 4 May 1904, Stade Rennais merged with its rivals FC Rennais to form\\nStade Rennais Universit\\u00e9 Club\\n, with the primary objective being to overcome the recent domination of the Ligue de Bretagne by\\nUS Saint-Malo\\n, then known as US Saint-Servan, which fielded mostly British players.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThe new club adopted the colours of Rennais, which consisted of a red and black combination with black vertical stripes on the shirt. After three years of Saint-Malo dominating the league, Rennes finally eclipsed the club in 1908 under the leadership of Welsh manager Arthur Griffith. In the following season, Rennes won the league again, but in 1910 Rennes was unable to win a third, as Saint-Malo won the league by two points. The champions subsequently went on an impressive run in which it won the league for the next four seasons over.\\nAfter\\nWorld War I\\n, Rennes began focusing its efforts on winning the recently created\\nCoupe de France\\n. Strengthened by the arrivals of internationals Bernard Lenoble, Maurice Gastiger,\\nErnest Molles\\nand captain\\nFran\\u00e7ois Hugues\\nafter the war, in the competition's fourth campaign, Rennes reached the final. In the\\nmatch\\n, the club faced two-time defending champions\\nRed Star Olympique\\n, which was led by attacker\\nPaul Nicolas\\n, defender\\nLucien Gamblin\\nand goalkeeper\\nPierre Chayrigu\\u00e8s\\n. Red Star opened the scoring in the fourth minute and the match was concluded following a late goal from Raymond Sentub\\u00e9ry.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nAfter the disorganisation of the USFSA in 1913, Rennes joined the Ligue de l'Ouest. In 1929, Rennes departed the league after disagreeing with the increased number of games the league sought to implement in the new season. The departure led to Rennes becoming a \\\"\\nfree agent\\n\\\", and the club played numerous friendly matches to compensate for the loss of league matches.\\nThe presidency of Isidore Odorico marked the history of the club during the 1920\\u20131930s.\\nIn July 1930, the National Council of the\\nFrench Football Federation\\n(FFF) voted 128\\u201320 in support of professionalism in French football. Under the leadership of club president Isidore Odorico, Rennes was among the first clubs to adopt the new statute and, subsequently, became professional and became founding members of the new league. In the\\nleague's inaugural season\\n, Rennes finished mid-table in its group. Two years later, in 1935, the club reached the\\nCoupe de France final\\nfor the second time. Rennes, however, lost to\\nMarseille\\n3\\u20130 after failing to overcome three first-half goals. The club's attack was also limited in the match due to being deprived of its top two attackers,\\nWalter Kaiser\\nand Walter Vollweiler, who were both injured. Rennes spent four more years in the first division before suffering relegation to Division 2 in the\\n1936\\u201337 season\\n. Rennes played in Division 2 before professionalism was abolished due to\\nWorld War II\\n. After the war, Rennes returned to Division 1. Led by the Austrian-born Frenchman\\nFranz Pleyer\\n, Rennes achieved its best finish in the league after finishing fourth in the\\n1948\\u201349 campaign\\n. Despite the domestic resurgence under Pleyer, the club struggled to maintain consistency and, in the 1950s, rotated between the first division and the second division under the watch of the Spaniard\\nSalvador Artigas\\nand\\nHenri Gu\\u00e9rin\\n, who acted in a player-coach role.\\nUnder the leadership of new president Louis Girard, Rennes underwent a major upheaval, which included renovations to the stadium. Girard sought to make Rennes competitive nationally and the first objective was achieved when the club earned promotion back to Division 1 in 1958. After finishing in the bottom-half of the table for six-straight seasons, Rennes, now managed by former club player\\nJean Prouff\\n, finished in fourth place in the\\n1964\\u201365 season\\n. In the same season, the club earned its first major honour after winning the Coupe de France. Rennes, led by players such as\\nDaniel Rodighi\\u00e9ro\\n,\\nGeorges Lamia\\nand Jean-Claude Lavaud defeated\\nUA Sedan-Torcy\\n3\\u20131 in the replay of\\nthe final\\n. The first leg of the match ended 2\\u20132, which resulted in a replay. After the cup success, Rennes played in\\nEuropean competition\\nfor the first time in the\\n1965\\u201366 season\\n, participating in the\\nEuropean Cup Winner's Cup\\n. The club, however, lost to Czechoslovakian club\\nDukla Prague\\nin the first round.\\nJean Prouff\\n, pictured in 1935, led Rennes to its major successes.\\nIn the ensuing years, Rennes struggled in league play but performed well in the Coupe de France, reaching the semi-finals on two occasions in 1967 and 1970. In 1971, Rennes captured its second Coupe de France title after defeating\\nLyon\\n1\\u20130 in the\\nfinal\\n, with the only goal coming from the penalty spot scored by\\nAndr\\u00e9 Guy\\n.\\nOn 23 May 1972, Rennes officially changed its name to its current form,\\nStade Rennais Football Club\\n. After another season in charge, Prouff departed Rennes and the club entered free-fall. From 1972 to 1994, Rennes was supervised by 11 different managers and, during the years, constantly hovered between Division 1 and Division 2. In 1978, the club was on the verge of bankruptcy and, as a result, was ordered by a\\ntribunal\\nto sell its biggest earners and enter a policy of\\nausterity\\n. In the 1980s, the city's municipality gained a majority stake in the club.\\nIn 1994, Rennes returned to Division 1 and entered a period of stability mainly due to the utilisation of the club's youth academy. Instead of entering bidding wars for players, Rennes groomed its youngsters and inserted them onto the senior team when coaches felt they were ready. This strategy proved successful with players such as\\nSylvain Wiltord\\n,\\nJocelyn Gourvennec\\n, and\\nUlrich Le Pen\\n. In 1998, the club was sold by the municipality to retail\\nmagnate\\nFran\\u00e7ois Pinault\\n. Pinault invested a substantial amount of funding into the club and sought to increase Rennes' production of youth talent by constructing a\\ntraining centre\\n, which was completed in 2000. Pinault also paid for a completed re-construction of the stadium and also invested in the transfer market, recruiting several players from South America, most notably Brazilian forward\\nLucas Severino\\n, whom Rennes paid a record \\u20ac21\\u00a0million for in 2000.\\nThe results were immediate in the decade from 2000 to 2010, with Rennes appearing in UEFA-sanctioned European competitions in five of the ten seasons. In youth production, the club produced several youth talents such as\\nYann M'Vila\\n,\\nYacine Brahimi\\n,\\nJimmy Briand\\nand\\nAbdoulaye Diallo\\n, among others. In league competition, Rennes tied its best finish ever in the league by finishing fourth in\\n2004\\u201305\\n. Two seasons later, the club accomplished this feat again. In 2009, Rennes reached the\\nCoupe de France final\\nfor the fourth time in its history. In the final, Rennes faced Breton rival\\nGuingamp\\nand was the heavy favourite. Despite taking the lead in the second half, however, Rennes was defeated 2\\u20131 after Guingamp scored two goals in a ten-minute span. In 2014, Rennes made the\\nCoupe de France final\\nand once again their opponent was\\nGuingamp\\n. In a tense final, Rennes lost the match to their fierce rivals 2\\u20130.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nIn the\\n2017\\u201318 Ligue 1 season\\n, Rennes had one of their best campaigns in recent memory, finishing 5th and qualifying to the UEFA Europa League for the 2018\\u201319 season.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nIn the following season, the\\n2018\\u201319 season\\n, Rennes had irregular form in the league, finishing tenth, but claimed its third Coupe de France win on 27 April, rallying back from two goals down to beat\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n6\\u20135 on penalties in the\\nfinal\\n.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nThe French Cup winners for the last four years were heavy favourites to beat Rennes having already been crowned Ligue 1 champions for the 2018\\u201319 season on 21 April.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nThe club also had a great Europa League campaign, where they reached the round of 16 after finishing second in the group stage. In the round of 32, they beat\\nReal Betis\\n6\\u20134 on aggregate, and in the round of 16, they were matched up with\\nArsenal\\n. In the first leg on 7 March, Rennes recorded a historic 3\\u20131 victory at home.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nIn the second leg however, eventual finalists Arsenal won 3\\u20130 in\\nLondon\\nand eliminated the French club.\\nIn the\\n2019\\u201320 season\\n, Rennes finished third in Ligue 1 and qualified for\\n2020\\u201321 UEFA Champions League\\nfor the first time in their history.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nStadium\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nRoazhon Park\\nThe\\nHermine\\nsymbols outside the Roazhon Park\\nRennes has played on the land where the club's stadium, the\\nRoazhon Park\\n, situates itself since 1912. The Roazhon Park, then named Stade de Route de Lorient, which is its address, was constructed in 1912. The facility was inaugurated on 15 September 1912 in a match between Rennes and SA du Lyc\\u00e9e de Rennes. The Stade de la Route de Lorient was officially inaugurated a month later when Rennes took on\\nRacing Club de France\\nin front of 3,000 spectators.\\nThe Roazhon Park is owned by the city of Rennes and has undergone renovations three times, in 1955, 1983 and 1999. In 1983, the club renovated the stadium in an attempt to resemble the\\nOlympiastadion\\nin Munich. After nearly four years of renovation, the new stadium was unveiled on 7 March 1987. In 1999, the new renovations, which were designed by architect Bruno Gaudin, cost \\u20ac37.3\\u00a0million and took four years to complete. The stadium's inauguration was celebrated twice: in a match between\\nFrance\\nand\\nBosnia and Herzegovina\\nin August 2004, and another football match contesting by Rennes and\\nMetz\\ntwo months later. The current capacity of the stadium is 29,778.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nTraining centre\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nStade Rennais FC Training Centre\\nThe entrance to the \\u00c9cole Technique Priv\\u00e9e Odorico, a section of the Stade Rennais youth academy\\nThe Centre d'entra\\u00eenement Henri-Gu\\u00e9rin (Henri-Gu\\u00e9rin Training Center), colloquially known as\\nLa Piverdi\\u00e8re\\n, was inaugurated in June 2000. Named for former club player and manager\\nHenri Gu\\u00e9rin\\n,\\nLa Piverdi\\u00e8re\\nis located on the outskirts of Rennes just southwest of Roazhon Park. The centre hosts the senior team's training sessions, as well as the club's reserve and youth teams. In 2007,\\nLa Piverdi\\u00e8re\\nbecame the home of the club's administrative and business headquarters.\\nSince its inception,\\nLa Piverdi\\u00e8re\\nhas become reputed for its consistent production of youth talent, bringing through players that have become household names at the international level. In that time, the club's youth system has made up most of the club's first team.\\nCurrent\\nfirst-team players\\nEduardo Camavinga\\nand\\nJoris Gnagnon\\nwere graduates of the academy. Rennes has been awarded the honour of having the best youth academy in France.\\nRennes has won the\\nCoupe Gambardella\\n, the under-19 national youth competition, three times, in 1973, 2003 and 2008. In 2003, the team that won was anchored by\\nYoann Gourcuff\\nand Marveaux. Gourcuff went on to win both the\\nUNFP Player of the Year\\nand\\nFrench Player of the Year\\nawards and established himself as a\\nFrench international\\n. Marveaux graduated from the academy after the Gambardella triumph and went on to appear in over 100 matches for Rennes. He had his best season in the\\n2009\\u201310 season\\n, appearing in 38 matches and scoring 12 goals. In 2008, the team that won the competition was composed of Brahimi, M'Vila, Souprayen,\\nYohann Lasimant\\n, Quentin Rouger, K\\u00e9vin Th\\u00e9ophile-Catherine, and\\nDamien Le Tallec\\n. Six of the seven players made appearances with the first-team. Le Tallec moved to German club\\nBorussia Dortmund\\nbefore he could make an appearance.\\nSupporters\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFlares of the\\nRoazhon Celtic Kop\\nat the Roazhon Park\\nRennes have several supporter groups associated with the club, ranging from groups of senior supporters to\\nultras\\n. The oldest, most structured and frequented is Allez Rennes. The group was founded in 1962 and together with\\nLes Socios\\n, founded in 1992, is the largest group of traditional supporters.\\nThe section of the stadium popularly called\\nTribune Mordelles\\nis occupied by the Roazhon Celtic Kop (RCK). Although the group was founded in 1991, its roots date back to 1987 when a group of supporters known as Ultras Roazhon was formed. The RCK was formed by three young supporters who decided to establish the Mordelles stand as the true hot spot of the stadium.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nThe group marks its presence not only through continuous singing and the use of flares, but also through numerous tifos and choreographic celebrations. The Breton identity is regularly displayed and the use of\\nCeltic\\nsymbols is frequent.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nA special feat of the RCK is that the group is responsible for having made the largest\\nGwenn-ha-du\\nin history measuring 270 square metres. It was displayed at the Mordelles stand during the 1994\\u201395 season.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nThe RCK giving homage to the deceased former player\\nJean Prouff\\nin 2008\\nThe RCK functions as an unconditional supporters' group present at all matches, including those at European level, and gathers supporters mainly of the\\nultra\\n-mentality, but also holds on to its values describe by the group as\\nAmiti\\u00e9, Respect et F\\u00eate\\n(\\nFriendship, Respect and Party\\n). The Kop keeps an open attitude towards those supporters of Rennes who share them.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nThe group has taken a strong position against \\\"football business\\\", the suppression of the\\nultra\\n-movement\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nand racism. Although the group is not officially political, it regularly manifests\\nanti-fascism\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe RCK is a member of the RSRA (R\\u00e9seau Supporter de R\\u00e9sistance Antiraciste),\\n[\\n18\\n]\\na French network of football supporter groups against racism, and involved in\\nFare\\n, a European network of football supporter groups against racism and discrimination.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nAnother major supporter group of the club is the Section Roazhon Pariz. It is a section of the RCK that is situated in Paris. The group supports the team at important away matches, such as those against\\nLyon\\nand\\nParis Saint-Germain\\n.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nThe RCK makes no attempt to hide its chaotic and festive appearance. In 2003, a second group of ultras, the Breizh Stourmer (\\\"Breton Warriors\\\") was formed through a break with the RCK. The group was created around the idea of a small, strong core of supporters and chose to situate themselves on the opposite side of the RCK. The Breizh Stourmer has been accused by elements of the RCK for certain members holding extreme-right views.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nViolent clashes between radical members of the two groups have occurred. The main rival of the RCK has, however, not been the Breizh Stourmer, but for many years, the Brigade Loire, a supporters' group of Rennes' rival club\\nNantes\\n. The Breizh Stourmer has since dissolved. In 2008, a new group of supporters, the Unvez Kelt (UK) (\\\"Celtic Unity\\\"), was founded. The group was initially refused by the club as an official group, however, with the help of Les Socios, it was finally accepted.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nFailing to establish itself and after several problems, among them a fire that destroyed its premises in November 2010,\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nclashes with the\\nNational Police\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nand incidents resulting in several of its members becoming arrested during an away match at\\nAuxerre\\nin 2012,\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nthe Unvez Kelt decided to dissolve in 2012.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nPlayers\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCurrent squad\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAs of 5 September 2025\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under\\nFIFA eligibility rules\\n; some limited exceptions apply.
