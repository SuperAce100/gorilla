The instructions say to say \"I do not know\" if I'm uncertain, but I can give a brief framework too.

I could say \"I do not know\" and then ask questions like, \"Can you share your major, favorite classes, or career goals?\" But I'm unsure where to place these questions without exceeding the format constraints. It might work to include a brief answer and context, while also asking a concise question in my response. This will keep things clear and focused!\n**Gathering research preferences**\n\nI can suggest 3-5 research areas and potential advisors, but I need more information about the user's academic interests to tailor my recommendations. The instruction indicates I should remember key personal and academic details, but right now, I don't have any data stored. Since they\u2019re a college student, it might be useful to propose a quick diagnostic for them. I\u2019ll craft an answer that asks for their interests and provide examples of available pathways. Let\u2019s keep it concise!\n**Suggesting a decision method**\n\nI think I can suggest a method to help determine research areas by considering the intersection of problem domains, preferred methods, and desired career outcomes. For example, if someone enjoys math and data, they might look into machine learning theory, while a preference for biology and wet labs could lead to molecular genetics. \n\nI'll format my answer to ask for their major, favorite classes, problems they care about, preferred work style, and career goals.

I\u2019m thinking of asking a follow-up question later, but for now, I should acknowledge that I don't know the answer definitively. It\u2019s a bit tricky because I could suggest tasks, but that feels like guessing. I think it\u2019s better to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d for both fields. I can also remember that the user mentioned washing the car and another potential task.\n**Evaluating task storage**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether it's appropriate to store \u201cwash the car on Sunday.\u201d Capturing tasks and deadlines is helpful, but I wonder if I need the user's confirmation before writing it down. The system suggests that proactively managing memory is good, so maybe I can tentatively store it. However, I think it\u2019s better to ask for permission. Since the user mentioned washing the car on Sunday, I can add it as a task but note it as due on the next Sunday without a specific date.\n**Storing task preferences**\n\nI realize we need a specific date for reminders, but I can at least note the preference: \"Task: wash the car on Sunday (upcoming).\" Adding minimal memory seems fine. Plus, I can capture that there's a second car-related task that\u2019s unknown, even though it\u2019s not actionable right now. The guidelines encourage actively managing memory, so I think storing \"wash car on Sunday\" is appropriate. I\u2019ll use the memory tool to add this, while being careful about the user's needs and clarifications.\n**Managing memory storage**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that storing ambiguous memory might be okay since I can update it later. However, I need to consider whether we should combine multiple tool calls. I only need one append, but a structured memory format would be better for retrieval. The memory tools accept free text, so I\u2019ll append properly structured items with bullet lines. I can't rely on recursive summarization, but I can ask for confirmation in a follow-up while being mindful of the user\u2019s expectations for immediate help. However, I can\u2019t do that in the final JSON response.\n**Appending memory tasks**\n\nI\u2019m debating if we can prompt the user in the context field, but the instructions say to respond with \u201cI do not know\u201d if uncertain. I\u2019ll store the task as \"Wash the car on Sunday (user's plan)\" using memory_append, while returning the default JSON with both fields saying \"I do not know.\" Since they mentioned washing the car, it seems implied for Sunday, so I'll note \"Weekly car task: Wash car on Sunday.\" \n\nI'll also add that the user suspects another car-related task on Sunday. Since storage of ambiguous information isn't super helpful, I\u2019ll keep it minimal and proceed with appending these tasks.

I\u2019m thinking of asking a follow-up question later, but for now, I should acknowledge that I don't know the answer definitively. It\u2019s a bit tricky because I could suggest tasks, but that feels like guessing. I think it\u2019s better to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d for both fields. I can also remember that the user mentioned washing the car and another potential task.\n**Evaluating task storage**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether it's appropriate to store \u201cwash the car on Sunday.\u201d Capturing tasks and deadlines is helpful, but I wonder if I need the user's confirmation before writing it down. The system suggests that proactively managing memory is good, so maybe I can tentatively store it. However, I think it\u2019s better to ask for permission. Since the user mentioned washing the car on Sunday, I can add it as a task but note it as due on the next Sunday without a specific date.\n**Storing task preferences**\n\nI realize we need a specific date for reminders, but I can at least note the preference: \"Task: wash the car on Sunday (upcoming).\" Adding minimal memory seems fine. Plus, I can capture that there's a second car-related task that\u2019s unknown, even though it\u2019s not actionable right now. The guidelines encourage actively managing memory, so I think storing \"wash car on Sunday\" is appropriate. I\u2019ll use the memory tool to add this, while being careful about the user's needs and clarifications.\n**Managing memory storage**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that storing ambiguous memory might be okay since I can update it later. However, I need to consider whether we should combine multiple tool calls. I only need one append, but a structured memory format would be better for retrieval. The memory tools accept free text, so I\u2019ll append properly structured items with bullet lines. I can't rely on recursive summarization, but I can ask for confirmation in a follow-up while being mindful of the user\u2019s expectations for immediate help. However, I can\u2019t do that in the final JSON response.\n**Appending memory tasks**\n\nI\u2019m debating if we can prompt the user in the context field, but the instructions say to respond with \u201cI do not know\u201d if uncertain. I\u2019ll store the task as \"Wash the car on Sunday (user's plan)\" using memory_append, while returning the default JSON with both fields saying \"I do not know.\" Since they mentioned washing the car, it seems implied for Sunday, so I'll note \"Weekly car task: Wash car on Sunday.\" \n\nI'll also add that the user suspects another car-related task on Sunday.
