Here\\u2019s who\\u2019s up, who\\u2019s down, who\\u2019s off the list and why it matters more than ever.\\nT\\nhe world\\u2019s billionaires\\nhave always been rich and powerful\\u2014but never more than now. That\\u2019s particularly true in the United States, where Donald Trump was sworn in (again) as America\\u2019s billionaire-in-chief in January. This time around, he\\u2019s giving the billionaire class more control over the government than ever before. His right-hand man is the planet\\u2019s richest person. His administration includes at least ten billionaires and billionaire spouses. And scores of billionaire execs\\u2014from Meta\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg to French luxury goods kingpin Bernard Arnault\\u2014have lined up behind Trump.\\nThe billionaire bonanza extends beyond the U.S., however. A record 3,028 people around the globe make\\nForbes\\n\\u2019 annual\\nWorld\\u2019s Billionaires list\\nthis year, 247 more than last year. It\\u2019s the first time the billionaire population has crossed the 3,000 mark. They\\u2019re worth a record $16.1 trillion in all, $2 trillion more than a year ago and more than the GDP of every country in the world besides the U.S. and China. The average fortune now stands at $5.3 billion, up $200 million from 2024.\\nThere are now three people worth more than $200 billion for the first time ever, part of the record 15 members of the\\n$100 Billion Club\\n, the elite group at the very top of the list whose net worths span a dozen digits. That\\u2019s up from 14 a year ago and none in 2017. These 15 centibillionaires are worth $2.4 trillion\\u2014more than the bottom 1,500 billionaires combined.\\nThe richest of all is\\nElon Musk\\n, worth an estimated $342 billion. Despite spending a lot more of his (already divided) time heading DOGE, Trump\\u2019s cost-cutting operation, Musk has added $147 billion to his fortune over the past year, thanks to a blockbuster year for his rocket company SpaceX and his AI firm xAI (which he merged with his social media giant X last week). Even Tesla, despite recent protests and a stock market selloff, is trading higher than a year ago. That\\u2019s allowed Musk to reclaim the title of world\\u2019s richest person from Arnault, and has given him a $126 billion lead over the next richest person: Meta\\u2019s\\nMark Zuckerberg\\n(estimated net worth: $216 billion), who ranks No. 2 for the first time. Amazon\\u2019s\\nJeff Bezos\\n($215 billion) ranks No. 3 and Oracle\\u2019s\\nLarry Ellison\\n($192 billion) ranks fourth.\\nArnault\\n($178 billion), meanwhile, slides down to fifth, his lowest rank since 2017, amid a slump in shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH.\\nForbes\\nused stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025 for this year\\u2019s ranking.\\nThe\\nUnited States,\\nwith a record 902 billionaire citizens,\\ncontinues to boast\\nmore billionaires than anywhere else\\non the planet.\\nChina\\n, with 516 (including Hong Kong), remains second and\\nIndia\\n, with 205, still ranks third. More than 50% of all listees are citizens of one of these three countries, but altogether 76 nations and two semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire, including\\nAlbania\\nfor the first time ever.\\nForbes\\nalso\\nadded 15 from\\nSaudi Arabia\\nthis year\\n, after removing the Kingdom\\u2019s billionaires in 2018 following a government crackdown.\\nIn all,\\n288 fresh faces\\njoin the annual Billionaires ranking this year. That includes celebrities such as rockstar\\nBruce Springsteen\\n($1.2 billion), movie star\\nArnold Schwarzenegger\\n($1.1 billion) and comedian\\nJerry Seinfeld\\n($1.1 billion). Also new: controversial crypto kingpin\\nJustin Sun\\n($8.5 billion), several artificial intelligence tycoons from such companies as Anthropic, CoreWeave and DeepSeek, and the moguls behind several notable food chains: Cava,\\nChipotle\\n,\\nJersey Mike\\u2019s\\nand\\nZaxby\\u2019s\\n.\\nThe wealthiest newcomer of all is\\nMarilyn Simons\\n($31 billion), the widow of hedge fund legend Jim Simons, who died in May 2024. He was one of 32 billionaires who died over the past year. (Another, Israeli industrial titan\\nStef Wertheimer\\n, died in late March, after we locked in the list, and thus appears in the ranks.)\\nSimons is one of just\\n406 women\\namong the World\\u2019s Billionaires, only 13.4% of the list, up a hair from 13.3% last year. Nearly three-quarters inherited their fortunes. That includes the\\nworld\\u2019s richest woman\\n, Walmart heir\\nAlice Walton\\n($101 billion), who has overtaken French L\\u2019Oreal heir\\nFrancoise Bettencourt Meyers\\n($81.6 billion) for the top spot among women.\\nForbes\\nfound just 113 self-made women around the globe, the richest of whom is Swiss shipping tycoon\\nRafaela Aponte-Diamant\\n($37.7 billion) whose company\\nteamed with BlackRock this year\\non a plan to buy 43 ports, including two in Panama.\\nOverall, 67% of the list is self-made\\u2014meaning they founded or cofounded their company or established their own fortune, rather than inheriting it\\u2014up from 66% in 2024. The youngest self-made billionaire is Scale AI cofounder and CEO\\nAlexandr Wang\\n($2 billion), who is 28.\\nWang is one of just\\n21 billionaires who are 30 or younger\\n, including\\nJohannes von Baumbach\\n($5.4 billion), a 19-year-old heir to a German pharmaceuticals fortune, a newcomer who is now the world\\u2019s youngest billionaire. The oldest billionaire, at age 103, is U.S. insurance tycoon\\nGeorge Joseph\\n($1.9 billion), one of four listees who have hit the century mark. The average billionaire is 66 years old.\\nFew billionaires have had a better year than\\nDonald Trump\\n\\u2014and not just because he retook the U.S. presidency. Before moving back into the White House, he padded his cash pile with a very lucrative move into crypto. Between that and his Trump Media & Technology Group going public just after\\nForbes\\nlocked in its 2024 rankings,\\nthe president\\u2019s net worth has more than doubled\\n, from an estimated $2.3 billion to an estimated $5.1 billion.\\nA small handful of billionaires, relatively speaking, didn\\u2019t fare so well. A total of 107 people who were on the 2024 ranking are simply no longer rich enough to make the cut. Notable drop-offs include Lisa Su, who is the CEO of semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sara Liu, cofounder of\\nembattled\\nserver and storage maker Supermicro; and Nicholas Puech, an heir to the Herm\\u00e8s luxury goods empire who says his fortune\\nhas vanished\\n.\\nThe World\\u2019s Billionaires list is a ranking of every person on the planet who\\nForbes\\nestimated to have a net worth of $1 billion U.S. dollars or more as of March 7, 2025. Some billionaires have gotten richer or poorer in the time since; indeed,\\nForbes\\nfound three more billionaires shortly after locking in this year\\u2019s list and there are likely more out there. Like most of our readers, we\\u2019re also bracing for the impact of tariffs on the global stock market. For daily updated rankings, see\\nForbes\\n\\u2019 Real-Time tracker\\n. When possible, we met with billionaires in person or spoke with them virtually or by phone. We also interviewed their employees, handlers, asset managers and financial advisors, rivals, peers and attorneys. Uncovering their fortunes required us to pore over thousands of Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory documents, court filings, probate records and news articles. We took into account all types of assets: stakes in public and private companies, real estate, art, yachts, planes, ranches, vineyards, jewelry, car collections and more. We factored in known debt and charitable giving. We exclude dispersed family fortunes, though we list wealth belonging to the immediate family of the living founder of a fortune under the founder\\u2019s name.

He started his career at Kraft Foods, and previously worked at Mondelez and Campbell. Now, his task is to turn around the fortunes of a company rich in brand names like Kool Aid, Jello-O and Lunchables, but struggling with its sales and stock price.\\nStrong\\nheadwinds are challenging\\nthe CPG sector overall\\u2014the three-year return for the\\ngroup\\n, as tracked by\\nYahoo\\nFinance, is down 21%, while the S&P\\nhas climbed around 8.75% over that same period.\\nMeanwhile, Kraft Heinz\\u2019s stock price peaked in 2017,\\nfalling from\\n$96.65 in February of that year to $20.06 in March of 2020, a 79% decline. The stock is currently hovering around $29. Along with nearly every other company in America, it\\u2019s now also facing a deeply uncertain tariff environment. Revenue declined last year, and in\\nQ1 earnings for 2025\\n, the company announced a 6.4% net sales decrease. It also lowered its outlook for organic net sales and adjusted EPS.\\nAbrams-Rivera has been particularly vocal about innovation, and how to make Kraft Heinz (No. 156 on the 2024\\nFortune 500\\n) think more like a tech company through things like the\\nAgile @ Scale\\ninitiative. That has been in play for four years and now includes around 75 interdisciplinary teams, which the company calls \\u201cagile pods,\\u201d to work on its biggest pain points and opportunities, including issues around product innovation and the supply chain.\\n\\u201cAs I looked around CPG, one of the things that struck me was that most of the companies who have used technical and digital tools to transform the company were not in CPG,\\u201d he told\\nFortune\\nin early April about his thinking when he joined the company. \\u201cThe way we talked about it at the company was: listen, we have to go in this new direction. And what we\\u2019re going to do is we\\u2019re going to basically cross this bridge and burn the bridge behind us.\\u201d\\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\\nYou\\u2019ve been CEO for a\\nlittle more than a year now\\n. What\\u2019s the biggest thing you\\u2019ve learned so far?\\nIt was certainly a different year than I expected, certainly a lot more eventful and a little more volatile. I think one thing that I\\u2019ve actually shared internally with the company is that in moments like this, it\\u2019s important not only to have plan A, but have plan A, B and C, because the reality is we cannot foresee everything, but we can be very sure about being able to control those things within our power. So having the clarity of no matter what head winds are coming at you that you were focused on driving execution on those things you can control, is probably one of the biggest learnings as I think about the first year.\\nThe other thing is, it gave me the opportunity last year to really connect to the company. As I went around the company, being able to see our people very excited about our company, very excited about our future, and frankly, that has given me quite a bit of inspiration. At the end of the year we had our engagement survey\\u2014in spite of a very turbulent 2024, we had the highest engagement we\\u2019ve ever had at this company. So even with the change in CEO, with the volatile environment, I think people are very much connected to our company, believe in what we\\u2019re doing, and believe in our future.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s important not only to have plan A, but have plan A, B, and C.\\u201d\\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera, CEO, Kraft Heinz\\nSpeaking to that volatility: last year revenue and sales were down last year. It looks like it\\u2019s\\ngoing to be\\na\\ntough year ahead\\n. What headwinds is the company facing right now?\\nI think first of all, as I said, it\\u2019s a volatile environment, I think we can all agree with that. And I think as we\\u2019re starting the year, what you\\u2019re seeing is a little bit more of the continuation of 2024 in terms of the consumer under pressure. That idea of the consumer continuing to focus on driving the best value, continuing to shop at different venues and expanding the number of trips they\\u2019re doing, we continue to see that.\\nThat expectation to potentially reduce interest rates hasn\\u2019t happened, and I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to happen for a while. So if you think about that consumer who is having to manage the cash flow of the family, whether that is their mortgage rates, their car payments, their credit cards, they\\u2019re going to be looking for value. And I think for me, the important thing is that us as a company continue to drive that sense of how we are going to be on their side to provide value-driven solutions.\\nValue is not necessarily about just price. Value is also about making sure we have products that have the highest quality, that have the great taste that the whole family can enjoy. So it has to be accessible, it has to be affordable. That\\u2019s where different packages come in. Making sure that we have products in different formats in stores, whether that is from a club store, to a\\nDollar General\\n, to a\\nWalmart\\n. We are going to be in all those venues, in different sizes and packaging that a family can fit within the cash flow, but not compromising the quality and the great taste.\\nYou\\u2019ve talked about\\nwanting to innovate\\nat the company. How are you going about that, and what have been some hits and misses?\\nWe think about innovation in two ways. Yes, there is the traditional sense of us bringing new ideas to the world. But it\\u2019s also innovation in terms of renovating our core products. And we\\u2019re doing both.\\nIf you look at last year, we launched a new set of products on the\\nTaco Bell brand for meal kits\\nthat provided a great way for families to have the Taco Bell experience at home in a moment in which they\\u2019re looking for good value solutions. That business grew over 24% last year. We saw the consumer pain point, we provided a great value, and it was an innovation that was new to families in the U.S. Now we\\u2019re expanding that into Canada as well.\\nIn terms of more challenges, what I will say is there are places where consumers in the past maybe have been willing to spend a little more for, whether it\\u2019s premiumization or convenience, that right now they\\u2019re thinking maybe there\\u2019s a way for us to bring it home. So I think that those things we\\u2019re probably going to be doing less of, and we\\u2019re going to be focused a little more on our core products to make sure they deliver well. Overall it\\u2019s not only what we are doing, but what we are not doing\\u2014innovation that is going too far away from our core.\\nI\\u2019ll give you another example when we think about innovation in our core\\u2014the idea of us bringing a different packaging and a different size, it may not be a sexy innovation, but it\\u2019s a value added to consumers. We can sell a dollar version of our products at Dollar General, as a way for us to solve a pain point for our consumer. So as we think about our Capri Sun and now bringing it into the club environment, which for the first time, we\\u2019re out of the pouch, we now have it in a multi serve product for families\\u2014that is a core innovation. That may not be the sexiest type of innovation, but it solves a pain point for families that are looking for value too, and a way of keeping them in our franchise for longer.\\nYou\\u2019ve talked about focusing in part on emerging markets. Can you tell me more about that?\\nWe actually have increased volume over the last three years in emerging markets. Last year, [Heinz] grew double digits in emerging markets. So we are seeing that that\\u2019s a part of our business that continues to do well, that we still have a tremendous amount of white space for us to continue to grow in, and that we have proven already that we have grown.\\nHow are you thinking about the major\\ntariff policy changes\\nhappening on the national level right now?\\nWe are very dependent on the local farmers, local agriculture in order for us to deliver our product. Seventy percent of our revenue in Kraft Heinz globally comes from the U.S., and 99% of goods we sell in the U.S. are made in the U.S. So for us, it\\u2019s less of a concern, because our tomatoes are grown in California, our potatoes are grown between Oregon and Idaho.\\nWhat about selling products in Canada or Mexico?\\nMexico is less than 1% of our business, and 70% of the products that we sell in Canada are made in Canada. Our Heinz ketchup is coming from tomatoes that are grown in Canada. Our Philadelphia Cream Cheese is made with dairy from Canada. Our Kraft Mac & Cheese, coming from ingredients in Canada. So all those products are actually sourced locally, even in Canada for the most part.\\nConsumer sentiment was suffering already in 2024. It\\u2019s now reached its\\nlowest point since 2009\\n. Are you sticking with the same plan from last year, or making any adjustments?\\nThere\\u2019s a lot of articles being written about a potential recession\\u2014those are economic terms. If you are a family who makes $100,000 and your mortgage rate is high, and your cash payments are high, and you have a big credit card, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you call it, right? They\\u2019re managing their cash flow in the family, and we need to make sure we\\u2019re [giving] them products that have great quality, great taste and the same products that they can trust to bring to their homes.\\nWhatever is happening in terms of economic or stock market changes, that reality is true in 2024 and so far has continued into 2025. So that\\u2019s the way in which we can now approach the way we think about providing solutions for families. We have to have the agility for us to move quickly as families may need different things.\\nOne of the things that we\\u2019re seeing right now is, again, the idea of families looking for smaller baskets when they go shopping, but going to more places to do the shopping, is something that continues into 2025. So for us, our focus on driving our distribution, so that no matter whether they\\u2019re shopping online, they\\u2019re shopping at drug [stores], they\\u2019re shopping at club [stores], that we are there for them with the right format. So that idea of us continuing to bring that agility in this environment is our focus as we go through the year.\\nWhat we are also watching is making sure that in those moments in which families have special occasions, that we also have the right value proposition, in particular, in those critical moments throughout the year. There\\u2019s going to be Memorial Day, there\\u2019s going to be July Fourth\\u2014making sure we have the products with the right price for that particular family, so that they can have a great experience on that particular occasion. So we are going to be also looking at places where it makes sense for us to be a little more thoughtful about our pricing to make sure we can make a better experience for families during those particular moments.\\nWe know that we can be there for those special occasions. That family would also use [our products] afterwards throughout the year. So with both making sure that we are providing the solutions, no matter what the format is, no matter where they\\u2019re shopping, and then in those critical moments throughout the year, when we see a lot of families coming to us for opportunities to solve occasion-driven behaviors, and get-togethers, that we are there with the right price, because we know that will help also create the loyalty in the future.\\nFortune Global Forum\\nreturns Oct. 26\\u201327, 2025 in Riyadh.

Better AGI benchmarks clearly discern capabilities. The best AGI benchmarks do all this and actively inspire research and guide innovation.\\nAt ARC Prize, our mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks, directing efforts towards systems capable of general intelligence and significantly compressing the timeline for scientific breakthroughs.\\nARC-AGI-1 has measured progress towards AGI since 2019 and was the only benchmark to\\npinpoint the exact moment in late 2024\\nwhen AI moved beyond pure memorization. OpenAI used ARC-AGI-1 to demonstrate this progress with their o3-preview system which combines deep learning-based LLMs with reasoning synthesis engines.\\nARC Prize 2024 inspired thousands of independent\\nstudents\\nand\\nresearchers\\nto work alongside frontier labs on new test-time adaption ideas.\\nBut there is more work to do to reach AGI. AGI still needs new ideas.\\nWe can characterize systems like o3-preview as going from \\\"zero to one\\\" on the fluid intelligence spectrum. But these systems are highly inefficient and currently require significant human supervision during the training process to adapt to new domains.\\nAnnouncements\\nToday we\\u2019re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.\\nAlongside it, today we're launching\\nARC Prize 2025\\n, designed to drive open-source progress on highly efficient, general systems capable of beating ARC-AGI-2.\\nEasy for Humans, Hard for AI\\nAll other AI benchmarks focus on superhuman capabilities or specialized knowledge by testing \\\"PhD++\\\" skills. ARC-AGI is the only benchmark that takes the opposite design choice \\u2013 by focusing on tasks that are relatively easy for humans, yet hard, or impossible, for AI, we shine a spotlight on capability gaps that do not spontaneously emerge from \\\"scaling up\\\".\\nThe ARC Prize Foundation adapts this into our definition for measuring AGI: the gap between the set of tasks that are easy for humans and hard for AI. When this gap is zero, when there are no remaining tasks, we can find that challenge AI, we will have achieved AGI.\\nAddressing these capability gaps requires novel insight and new ideas. Importantly, ARC-AGI does not exist purely to measure AGI progress. It also exists to inspire researchers to work on new ideas.\\nIntelligence requires the ability to generalize from limited experience and apply knowledge in new, unexpected situations. AI systems are already superhuman in many specific domains (e.g., playing Go and image recognition.) However, these are narrow, specialized capabilities. The \\\"human-ai gap\\\" reveals what's missing for general intelligence - highly efficiently acquiring new skills.\\nIntroducing ARC-AGI-2\\nARC-AGI-2 Technical Paper\\nThe ARC-AGI-2 benchmark launches today. This second edition in the ARC-AGI series raises the bar for difficulty for AI while maintaining the same relative ease for humans.\\nEvery ARC-AGI-2 task was solved by at least 2 humans in 2 attempts or less in a controlled study with hundreds of human participants. This matches the rules we hold for AI, which gets two attempts per task.\\nARC-AGI-1, introduced in 2019, was designed to challenge deep learning. Specifically, it was designed to resist the ability to simply \\\"memorize\\\" the training dataset. ARC-AGI comprises a training dataset and several evaluation sets, including a private eval set used for the ARC Prize 2024 contest. The training set is intended to teach the Core Knowledge Priors required to solve tasks in the evaluation sets. To solve the evaluation tasks, AI systems must demonstrate basic fluid intelligence or the ability to adapt to novel, never-before-seen tasks.\\nAs an analogy, think of the training set as a way to learn grade school math symbols, and the evaluation set requires you to solve algebra equations using your knowledge of those symbols. You cannot simply memorize your way to the answer, you must apply existing knowledge to new problems.\\nAny AI system capable of beating ARC-AGI-1 demonstrates a binary level of fluid intelligence. In contrast, ARC-AGI-2 significantly raises the bar for AI. To beat it, you must demonstrate\\nboth\\na high level of adaptability and high efficiency.\\nWhile designing ARC-AGI-2, we studied these properties of frontier AI reasoning systems. Below are example tasks to illustrate some of what we discovered. All of the following tasks are part of ARC-AGI-2 and were (1) solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts and (2) unsolved by any frontier AI reasoning system.\\nNote: special thank you to the ARC Prize community for contributing to this analysis, including\\nMace\\n,\\nMikel\\n, and many members in the\\nARC Prize Discord\\n.\\nStill Hard for AI\\nSymbolic Interpretation\\nWe found that frontier AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring symbols to be interpreted as having meaning beyond their visual patterns. Systems attempted symmetry checking, mirroring, transformations, and even recognized connecting elements, but failed to assign semantic significance to the symbols themselves.\\nExample of symbolic interpretation, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #e3721c99.\\nTry this task.\\nCompositional Reasoning\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring simultaneous application of rules, or application of multiple rules that interact with each other. In contrast, if a task only has one, or very few, global rules, we found these systems can consistently discover and apply them.\\nExample of compositional reasoning, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #cbebaa4b.\\nTry this task.\\nContextual Rule Application\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks where rules must be applied differently based on context. Systems tend to fixate on superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying selection principles.\\nExample of contextual rule application, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #b5ca7ac4.\\nTry this task.\\nDatasets\\nARC-AGI-2 is comprised of the following datasets:\\nDataset\\nTask Quantity\\nCalibration\\nVisibilty\\nDescription\\nTraining\\n1000\\nUncalibrated\\nPublic\\nA spectrum of difficulty ranging from very easy to very difficult for both humans and AI, designed to expose and teach Core Knowledge Priors; use to train your system.\\nPublic Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPublic\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans; use to test your system.\\nSemi-Private Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for the Kaggle live contest leaderboard and ARC Prize leaderboard. \\\"Semi\\\" means these tasks may have been exposed to limited third-parties (e.g., via API.)\\nPrivate Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for Kaggle final contest leaderboard. \\\"Private\\\" means these tasks have not been exposed to third-parties.\\nCalibrated\\nmeans that these tasks are IDD (independent and identically distributed). In principle, non-overfit scores across the public, semi-private, and private eval sets should be directly comparable. To gather these data, we tested with over 400 humans live in a controlled setting. Human solvability data for public tasks will be open-sourced alongside the ARC-AGI-2 paper in the coming weeks.\\nLike ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 uses a\\npass@2\\nmeasurement system to account for the fact that certain tasks have explicit ambiguity and require two guesses to disambiguate. As well as to catch any unintentional ambiguity or mistakes in the dataset. Given controlled human testing with ARC-AGI-2, we are more confident in the task quality compared to ARC-AGI-1.\\nHere's the official\\nchangelog\\nfor ARC-AGI-2:\\nAll eval sets (public, semi-private, private) now contain 120 tasks (up from 100).\\nRemoved tasks from eval sets that were susceptible to brute force search (all solved tasks from the original\\n2020 Kaggle contest\\n).\\nPerformed controlled human testing to calibrate eval set difficulty to ensure IDD and verify pass@2 solvability by at least 2 humans (to match AI rules).\\nDesigned new tasks to challenge AI reasoning systems based on study (symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, contextual rules, and more).\\nWe've also re-evaluated ARC-AGI-2 against all public AI systems. Here are the starting scores.\\nSystem\\nARC-AGI-1\\nARC-AGI-2\\nEfficiency (cost/task)\\nHuman panel (at least 2 humans)\\n98%\\n100%\\n$17\\nHuman panel (average)\\n64.2%\\n60%\\n$17\\no3-preview-low (CoT + Search/Synthesis)\\n75.7%\\n4%*\\n$200\\no1-pro (CoT + Search/Synthesis)\\n~50%\\n1%*\\n$200*\\nARChitects (Kaggle 2024 Winner)\\n53.5%\\n3%\\n$0.25\\no3-mini-high (Single CoT)\\n35%\\n0.0%\\n$0.41\\nr1 and r1-zero (Single CoT)\\n15.8%\\n0.3%\\n$0.08\\ngpt-4.5 (Pure LLM)\\n10.3%\\n0.0%\\n$0.29\\nScores labeled with * are in-progress estimates based on partial results we've been able to aggregate so far and o1-pro pricing. Full results will be published once available.\\nAll scores reported pass@2 and on the semi-private eval set (except ARC-AGI-1 human panel and ARChitects, which used public and private eval, respectively).\\nHuman panel efficiency is based upon a $115-150 show-up fee, plus a $5/task solve incentive. We optimized costs to produce show-ups (only 70% of registrations actually showed up). Even though we believe the true limit to human intelligence cost efficiency is likely in the $2-5/task range, we report $17/task to reflect the actual data we collected.\\nWe are looking forward to testing the production version of OpenAI o3-preview low/high once API access is available. Using ARC-AGI-1 tasks that transferred to ARC-AGI-2, we estimate that o3-preview-low would score ~4% and o3-high would potentially score up to 15-20% with very high compute (thousands of dollars per task).\\nIntelligence Is Not Just Capability\\nGoing forward, all ARC-AGI reporting will come along with an efficiency metric. We are starting with cost because it is the most directly comparable between human and AI performance.\\nIntelligence is not solely defined by the ability to solve problems or achieve high scores. The efficiency with which those capabilities are acquired and deployed is a crucial, defining component. The core question being asked is not just, \\\"Can AI acquire skill to solve a task?\\\" but also, \\\"At what efficiency or cost?\\\"\\nFrontier AI system scores on ARC-AGI-1 vs. ARC-AGI-2\\nWe know that brute-force search could eventually solve ARC-AGI (given unlimited resources and time to search). This would not represent true intelligence. Intelligence is about finding the solution efficiently, not exhaustively.\\nThis focus on efficiency is a core principle behind the ARC-AGI. We will now explicitly quantify the cost of intelligence, requiring solutions to demonstrate not just capability, but also the efficient use of resources that defines general intelligence.\\nOur\\nnew leaderboard page\\nreports progress along both a score and cost axis.\\nARC-AGI's new leaderboard showing both score and efficiency as of March 24, 2025\\nCompetition Now Open! $1,000,000 in Prizes\\nAlongside ARC-AGI-2, we're excited to announce\\nARC Prize 2025 is now live\\n!

Unlike benchmarks that test pattern recognition or brute-force computation, ARC-AGI challenges conceptual reasoning, an area traditionally dominated by human intelligence. By crossing the 85% threshold on this test, o3 has demonstrated capabilities that demand a reassessment of AI\\u2019s potential and its limitations.\\no3\\u2019s performance represents a pivotal moment in AI research for several reasons. First, it bridges the gap between task-specific models and those capable of reasoning more flexibly, akin to human cognition.\\nSecond, its success underscores the importance of designing rigorous benchmarks that push AI systems toward genuine understanding rather than rote learning.\\nThird, it highlights the evolving challenge of accurately measuring intelligence in advanced systems. As models like o3 push boundaries, benchmarks must adapt to remain relevant and rigorous, requiring new methodologies that go beyond brute computational force.\\nHowever, this achievement is not without caveats. Chollet, who collaborated with OpenAI on testing o3, points out that ARC-AGI v1 is nearing saturation, with ensemble approaches already scoring above 81%.\\nFurthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2 benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging, unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain knowledge. You\\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\\nOpenAI\\u2019s success with o3 highlights the role of high-compute, carefully curated datasets, and cutting-edge reasoning techniques in shaping the next generation of AI. It will be interesting to see whether the techniques behind o3 will be reproduced or extended by the open-source community in 2025.\\nUltimately, o3\\u2019s record-breaking ARC-AGI performance is both a milestone and a challenge, setting a new bar for what AI can achieve while emphasizing how much farther it has to go to reach true general intelligence.\\nChris McKay is the founder and chief editor of Maginative.

The average billionaire is 66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a select few have gotten super-rich super young.\\nThis year, the 25 youngest people on the\\nForbes\\n\\u2019\\nWorld\\u2019s Billionaires list\\nare all 33 or younger. Together they are worth $110 billion. A few are self-made, having built notable companies like Snap (Evan Spiegel, 33), Gymshark (Ben Francis, 31) and Oculus VR (Palmer Luckey, 31).\\nMost had a lot of help. For the first time since 2009, every billionaire under 30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs aging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years old and still in college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her minority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late grandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are two of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18 heirs among this set.\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who are worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based conglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and energy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of their father, Cyrus Mistry, who died less than three months after their revered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have\\njoined the list\\nin the past three years due to a father\\u2019s passing. Italy\\u2019s Clemente Del Vecchio, 19, received a hefty stake in the Italian-French maker of Ray-Ban, EssilorLuxottica, after the 2022 death of Leonardo Del Vecchio. His brothers Leonardo Maria, 28, and Luca, 22, also inherited fortunes, as did three older siblings. Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress to Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann, who died in January at age 84.\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational wealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the United States, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold $95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal Reserve. Trillions are expected to change hands every year as the affluent elderly pass away and leave their fortunes to descendants. Aging billionaires like Charles Koch, 88, and Phil Knight, 86, are currently\\npreparing to pass their inheritances\\non to their children.\\nAnother reason so many super-young billionaires are heirs: Many of the archetypal self-made young moguls, such as Snap\\u2019s Bobby Murphy (35) and Meta\\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg (39, United States), have grown up. They aren\\u2019t being replaced. This year, there\\u2019s just one self-made newcomer among the 25 youngest: Japan\\u2019s Shunsaku Sagami, 33, a merger and acquisitions dealmaker whose company M&A Research Institute Holdings uses AI to match clients. Its stock has spiked over 800% since it went public in June 2022, sending him\\nsoaring into the billionaire ranks\\n. And making fortunes young is no guarantee that entrepreneurs can hold onto them. Ryan Breslow was the youngest self-made billionaire last year at 28.\\nIf he hadn\\u2019t blown it\\n, he still would be.\\nNearly all of these 25 who made the ranks are richer than last year. The biggest year-over-year gain belongs to Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz, whose fortune is up by $4.9 billion, followed by Michal Strnad, who inherited and now runs the defense producer Czechoslovak Group and is worth $2.4 billion more than last year. Most of the youngest billionaires\\u201415, or 60%\\u2014are from Europe.

For the top tier of Hollywood talent, acting in a film has become just one element of a multi-year, multi-platform partnership between a studio and an actor to develop, produce, and most importantly market a project to audiences.\\nThose who have proven their ability to personally convert fans into customers have become more valuable than ever before. Johnson\\u2019s contract for\\nRed One\\n, which included up-front fees for acting and producing\\u2014as well as a buyout of back-end participation for both roles\\u2014will pay him an estimated $50 million, believed to be the highest fee-plus-buyout total in history for a single movie.\\nWhen combined with Johnson\\u2019s impressive deal for\\nMoana 2\\nand his catalog of older titles, he earned an estimated $88 million last year (after paying fees to his agent and lawyer), making him the highest-paid actor of 2024.\\nRight on his heels is Ryan Reynolds, who, similarly, was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the year\\u2019s biggest live-action theatrical hit,\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n. He even produced commercials for the movie through his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Reynolds\\u2019 busy year was rewarded with an estimated $85 million (after fees), though in the end 2024 might be remembered for the\\nswarm of lawsuits between his wife, Blake Lively, and\\nIt Ends With Us\\nfilmmaker Justin Baldoni\\n, which have seen his name littered throughout court documents.\\nClose behind Johnson and Reynolds, in third place, is another power promoter\\u2014Kevin Hart, whose unrivaled volume of self-produced movies, TV shows, podcasts and stand-up comedy continues to reinforce his status as the hardest-working man in show business, and brought in an estimated $81 million.\\nThose three multi-hyphenates earned the same amount as the rest of the top 10 combined, lapping veteran movie stars like Brad Pitt ($32 million), Nicole Kidman ($31 million) and\\n2023\\u2019s highest-paid actor, Adam Sandler\\n($26 million)\\u2014none of whom come with their own built-in marketing machine.\\nStill, it pays to be an established hitmaker from a previous generation. The average age of the top 20, who combined for more than $730 million in earnings last year, is a little over 54 years old. These actors benefit not only from high salaries set by the precedent of past hits, they continue to receive sizable checks each year from those old projects, whether it be TV shows\\u2014\\nForbes\\nestimates Jerry Seinfeld (No. 4 this year) pockets $30 million each year for creating\\nSeinfeld\\u2014\\nor decades\\u2019 worth of movies. For example, Matt Damon (No. 16) earned an estimated $8 million last year in profit participations from his back catalog, which includes the\\nBourne\\nand\\nOcean\\u2019s\\nfranchises.\\nThat has made it difficult for new stars to enter the top echelon of pay in Hollywood.\\nLast year\\u2019s top 20\\ndoesn\\u2019t include any actors in their 20s or 30s (the youngest is Scarlett Johansson, 40, at No. 19), even after a breakout year for young stars like Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell and Zendaya. Their fees have jumped for future projects, say representatives around Hollywood, and they are among the hardest actors to book right now, but the consensus is that they will need to continue to prove that the success came as a direct result of their billing in order to achieve top earnings in future years.\\nEven Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, 29, considered by the industry to be best positioned for mega-stardom, fell well short of this year\\u2019s list because his Oscar-nominated role as Bob Dylan in\\nA Complete Unknown\\nwas negotiated years ago, before\\nWonka\\nand\\nDune 2\\nturned him into a household name.\\nUnlike last year\\u2019s one-two punch of\\nBarbie\\nand\\nOppenheimer\\n, most of this year\\u2019s fortunes were made away from the box office. Six of the top 10 highest-grossing movies of 2024 were animated, an area of the business where actors generally don\\u2019t receive high salaries.\\nWith theatrical releases appearing increasingly risky, A-list talent instead flocked to streaming services, where so-called buyout deals are still the norm, paying talent a premium flat fee. In a competitive situation in which Apple, Amazon and Netflix are all vying for the same star-driven package, an actor might receive a total compensation well over the still-standard $20 million up-front fee for theatrical movies, as was the case with Pitt (No. 6) and George Clooney (No. 7) for\\nWolfs\\n.\\nWhether that trend continues, or whether the industry\\u2019s chants of \\u201csurvive to \\u201825\\u201d are rewarded with a box office renaissance this year, there remains an ironclad belief among agents, managers, lawyers and studio executives that movie stars are always going to be essential to the future of Hollywood.\\nUltimately, even more than the money earned, the annual list of the highest-paid actors represents a measure of the control that talent can wield within the industry, and how they choose to use it.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#1.\\nDwayne Johnson\\n$88 million ($103 million gross)\\nThe Rock returned to the top of the\\nhighest-paid actors\\nlist after landing what is believed to be the largest fee-plus-buyout in streaming movie history, an estimated $50 million to star in Amazon's\\nRed One\\nlast year. And when\\nMoana 2\\npivoted from a TV series to a theatrical release, he negotiated for a percentage of the movie's profits as an executive producer, an unprecedented deal for voice actors in Disney animation. After the movie grossed over $1 billion at the box office, Johnson, 52, made what one agent calls \\\"an ungodly amount of money.\\\"\\nTheo Wargo/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#2.\\nRyan Reynolds\\n$85 million ($100 million gross)\\nReynolds was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the biggest live action movie of the year in\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n, which grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide. But that was only part of a jam-packed year that included starring in John Krasinski's\\nIF\\n, producing a new season of\\nWelcome To Wrexham\\nfor Hulu, and depending on which version of the\\nBlake Lively-Justin Baldoni lawsuits\\nyou believe, reworking the script for his wife's movie\\nIt Ends With Us\\n.\\nAxelle/Bauer/Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#3. Kevin Hart\\n$81 million ($108 million gross)\\nNobody had a more diversified entertainment slate in 2024 than Hart, who starred in a theatrical release (\\nBorderlands\\n), a Netflix film (\\nLift\\n), an Amazon Prime movie (\\nDie Hart 2: Die Harter\\n), a series on The Roku Channel (\\nDie Hart\\nseason three), a series on Peacock (\\nFight Night\\n), the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix, a weekly podcast for SiriusXM (Gold Minds), not to mention 90 stand-up comedy shows. Add in commercial campaigns with DraftKings and Chase\\u2014not counted among his 2024 earnings\\u2014and you basically can't turn on any screen without seeing the 45-year-old comedian.\\nVictoria Will/Invision/AP\\n#\\n4.\\nJerry Seinfeld\\n$60 million ($70 million gross)\\nThe 70-year-old Seinfeld,\\nnamed a billionaire by\\nForbes\\nlast year, remains active on the stand-up circuit while his eponymous sitcom continues to bring in\\neight-figures every\\nyear. During the pandemic, he wrote a script spoofing the invention of Pop-Tarts,\\nUnfrosted\\n, which he eventually directed and starred in for Netflix last year.\\nDimitrios Kambouris/Vogue/Getty Images for The Met Museum\\n#5.\\nHugh Jackman\\n$50 million ($66 million gross)\\nAfter the emotional send-off of his Wolverine character in 2017's\\nLogan\\n, nothing short of a massive payday and the opportunity to work with his good friend Ryan Reynolds would have convinced the 56-year-old Jackman to don the adamantium claws once again. But\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\nwill likely end up being the most lucrative movie of his career.\\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images\\n#6. Brad Pitt\\n$32 million ($42 million gross)\\nAfter pulling\\nWolfs\\n(costarring his good friend George Clooney) from a theatrical release last year\\u2014opting to show it directly on AppleTV+\\u2014 Apple is betting the house on Pitt's 2025 movie\\nF1,\\nin theaters this summer. Meanwhile, his production company, Plan B, continues to be a juggernaut both at the box office (with\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice)\\nand on the awards circuit (backing longshot Best Picture nominee\\nNickel Boys)\\n.\\nGotham/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#7.\\nGeorge Clooney\\n$31 million ($37 million gross)\\nClooney publicly denied the reporting that he and Brad Pitt were paid $35 million each for the spy comedy\\nWolfs\\n\\u2014which he\\ncalled\\n\\\"bad for our industry if that\\u2019s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries\\u201d\\u2014but Apple had to outbid multiple suitors for the project in 2021. And compared to Clooney's directorial efforts or Pitt's more awards-inclined projects, one dealmaker tells\\nForbes\\nthe movie was \\\"definitely a for-profit endeavor for them.\\\"\\nStefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#8.\\nNicole Kidman\\n$31 million ($41 million gross)\\nThe reigning queen of AMC Theaters has become one of the most bankable stars in the TV miniseries space, starring in one for Netflix (\\nThe Perfect Couple\\n), one for Paramount+ (\\nLioness\\n), and one for Amazon (\\nExpats\\n) last year, making more than $1 million per episode in each. Add to that two movies featuring romances with much younger men\\u2014\\nBabygirl\\nand\\nA Family Affair\\n\\u2014and the 57-year-old Kidman is the highest-paid actress of 2024.\\nTodd Owyoung/NBC/Getty Images\\n#9.\\nAdam Sandler\\n$26 million ($35 million gross)\\nSandler's overall deal with Netflix is unrivaled in the industry, allowing him to make both big commercial projects like the upcoming\\nHappy Gilmore 2\\nor more modest fare like 2024's\\nSpaceman\\n, and\\nstill receive top dollar\\n. And the back catalog of last year\\u2019s highest-paid actor remains on the platform, racking up hundreds of millions of hours watched each year.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n#10.\\nWill Smith\\n$26 million ($30 million gross)\\nOpinions around Hollywood differ as to whether the 56-year-old Oscar winner is fully \\\"back\\\" after\\nThe Slap Seen \\u2018Round The World\\nin 2022, but all agree that returning to the character that first made him a star was as savvy move. And 2024\\u2019s\\nBad Boys: Ride or Die\\nwas a hit, one of less than 20 movies to gross more than $400 million worldwide last year.\\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images\\n#11.\\nMariska Hargitay\\n$25 million ($29 million gross)\\nAs the anchor for Dick Wolf\\u2019s\\nLaw & Order: SVU\\nfor more than 20 years and 550 episodes, the 61-year-old Hargitay is the highest-paid actor on television by a wide margin. She earns an estimated $750,000 per episode between acting and producing fees, as well as a slice of the show\\u2019s considerable syndication profits.\\nADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images\\n#12.\\nChanning Tatum\\n$24 million ($28 million gross)\\nDespite the box office failure of\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, Tatum\\u2019s earnings were in the stratosphere last year, as his deal was structured with a straight-to-streaming buyout of back-end participation. The 44-year-old Tatum also starred in\\nBlink Twice\\n, directed by his then-girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, and made a long-rumored (yet short-lived)\\ncameo as Gambit\\nin\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n.\\nMike Marsland/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#13.\\nJason Statham\\n$24 million ($25 million gross)\\nStatham, 57, has proven to be box office Teflon in recent years, stringing together a series of modest hits playing regular-guy action heroes, including 2024\\u2019s\\nThe Beekeeper\\n. He can command $20 million or more for such roles, in some cases nearly half of the movie\\u2019s production budget, all while operating without the representation of an agent or manager.\\nJordan Strauss/Invision/AP\\n#14.\\nMark Wahlberg\\n$23 million ($31 million gross)\\nWhen Wahlberg isn\\u2019t busy\\nrunning multiple companies\\nand crushing 4 a.m. workouts, the 53-year-old actor divides his efforts on-screen between bigger budget action movies, usually at Netflix, as was the case with last year\\u2019s\\nThe Union\\n, and more personal independent projects like\\nArthur The King\\n.\\nAndreas Rentz/Getty Images\\n#15.\\nMatt Damon\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nArtists Equity, the studio Damon cofounded with his longtime friend and collaborator Ben Affleck, continues to find willing buyers among the streaming services for projects produced by or starring the 54-year-old Oscar winner, including\\nThe Instigators\\nfor AppleTV+ in 2024. In addition to his up-front fees, Damon owns a piece of his movies\\u2019 equity, which sell at a premium price above their production budgets.\\nRebecca Cabage/Invision/AP\\n#16.\\nJohn Cena\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nCurrently on his farewell tour with the WWE, his wrestling home since 2002, the 47-year-old Cena has continued to be a bankable presence in streaming comedies across platforms. In 2024 he starred in\\nArgylle\\nfor Apple,\\nRicky Stanicky\\nfor Hulu, and\\nJackpot!\\nfor Amazon, and made appearances in Kevin Hart\\u2019s\\nDie Hart 2\\nand in one episode of\\nThe Bear.\\nErik Voake/Getty Images for WarnerMedia\\n#17.\\nDenzel Washington\\n$23 million ($27 million gross)\\nA villainous turn in\\nGladiator II\\nnetted another sizable payday, though the 70-year-old Washington will have to do without the laurels of an 11th Oscar nomination, which many Hollywood pundits predicted was coming. He also continues to receive hefty checks from the dozens of hits in his 40-year back catalog.\\nGabriel Olsen/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#18.\\nJake Gyllenhaal\\n$22 million ($26 million gross)\\nGyllenhaal\\u2019s 2024 remake of\\nRoad House\\nreportedly\\nfaced a choice\\nbetween a $60 million budget and a theatrical release, or an $85 million budget to go straight to Amazon Prime Video. The latter meant a bigger up-front payday for its 44-year-old star, without the gamble on box office performance. And it wasn\\u2019t the only remake Gyllenhaal fronted last year, as\\nPresumed Innocent\\nbecame a hit series on AppleTV+.\\nCindy Ord/Getty Images\\n#19.\\nScarlett Johansson\\n$21 million ($25 million gross)\\nIn addition to\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, which she costarred in with Channing Tatum, the 40-year-old actress lent her distinct voice to the lead role in the animated movie\\nTransformers One\\n. It\\u2019s a voice so distinct that Johansson said last May she\\nbelieves it was copied\\nby OpenAI for its chatbot.\\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#20.\\nJoaquin Phoenix\\n$19 million ($22 million gross)\\nReprising his Oscar-winning role as The Joker came with the biggest up-front fee of the 50-year-old Phoenix\\u2019s career, even though\\nJoker: Folie \\u00e0 Deux\\nbecame one of the biggest box office bombs of the year.\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nEstimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts, as well as data sources such as IMDBPro and Polestar. The figures represent pretax earnings for the calendar year 2024, minus fees for representation \\u2013 10% to agents, 10% to managers and 5% to lawyers, per industry standard, although some actors do not have all three.\\nActors were credited for all compensation on projects in the year they were released, despite the fact that often up front fees are paid when a movie is filmed, which could be years in the past, and back-end participation or buyouts are often paid several years into the future.\\nAdditionally, the ranking only includes earnings related to entertainment\\u2014acting, producing, directing, or other forms of performance (such as stand-up comedy). Entrepreneurial endeavors not related to entertainment, such as joint ventures, licensing, commercials or social media partnerships, were not counted.\\nMore from Forbes\\nForbes\\nWhy Hollywood Is Bearish On The Future Of Television\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nForbes\\nThe Highest-Paid TV Showrunners 2024\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nForbes\\nWhy This Film Financing Company Is The Safest Bet In Hollywood\\nBy\\nMatt Craig\\nGot a tip?

Callum Drift, head of\\nSanta Claus\\n's security detail, plans to retire after one last Christmas run, having become disillusioned with people's increasingly toxic behavior, exemplified by the growth of Santa's Naughty List. On\\nChristmas Eve\\n, an unidentified\\nblack ops\\nteam breaks into the\\nNorth Pole\\ncomplex and kidnaps Santa. MORA director Zoe Harlow's subordinates discover that Jack O'Malley, a freelance\\nblack-hat\\nhacker, compromised the Santa Claus's location.\\nZoe apprehends Jack for questioning. Jack, a longtime Santa skeptic, explains that Jack had no idea what the information meant and merely sent it to an anonymous buyer.\\nA mysterious woman kidnapped Santa and keeps Santa in a vault that siphons Santa's magic which knocks Santa unconscious.\\nZoe hires Jack to help find Santa and places a tracker on Jack and Callum reluctantly teams up with him. The mysterious woman and her\\nsons\\nduplicate the\\nGlask\\u00e4fig\\n, planning to imprison all the people who have ever been on the Naughty List.\\nJack and Callum track down Ted, the broker who bought the information, in\\nAruba\\n. Ted reveals that the kidnapper is the winter witch\\nGr\\u00fdla\\n. Gr\\u00fdla becomes aware of Jack, Callum and Ted's conversation from her name being spoken by Jack and sends her\\nsnowman\\nhenchmen to eliminate them. Although Callum and Jack are victorious, Ted is frozen before being questioned.\\nCallum suspects that Gr\\u00fdla is working with\\nKrampus\\n, Santa's estranged adoptive brother, Gr\\u00fdla's ex-lover, and the Naughty List's creator. Callum and Jack break into Krampus' lair but are captured. Callum appeals to Krampus to help Santa Claus, who misses Krampus, but Krampus refuses. Krampus reveals that Gr\\u00fdla came to Krampus to recover the\\nGlask\\u00e4fig\\n, a magical imprisoning\\nsnow globe\\n. Jack steals Callum's magic gauntlet back and returns the magic gauntlet to Callum, allowing the pair to escape.\\nGr\\u00fdla successfully tests the snow globes on Jack and his estranged son Dylan. Jack and Dylan, inside their respective globes, have a heartfelt conversation that, by making them \\\"nicer,\\\" causes the snow globes to break.\\nFollowing the implanted tracker, Zoe and Callum find Jack at the North Pole complex and realize that Gr\\u00fdla and her sons, along with Santa, have been inside the complex the entire time, having caused the search as a diversion. Zoe and Callim also learn that Gr\\u00fdla's team of shapeshifters has taken over the complex. Zoe and Callum find and free the imprisoned Mrs. Claus and other security staff. In Santa's old workshop, Zoe and Callum find Jack, Dylan, and the equipment that Gr\\u00fdla used to mass-produce the\\nGlask\\u00e4figs.\\nGr\\u00fdla prepares to leave with an unconscious Santa, using Santa's sleigh to distribute the\\nGlask\\u00e4figs.\\nA fight ensues, and Gr\\u00fdla is intercepted by Callum and Jack, with assistance from Krampus, who arrives to help. Santa recovers, defeats Gr\\u00fdla with the help of the flying reindeers, and seals Gr\\u00fdla inside a\\nGlask\\u00e4fig.\\nSanta and Krampus acknowledge each other and part ways peacefully. At the same time, Gr\\u00fdla is taken into Zoe's custody.\\nEverybody prepares for the Christmas Eve run. Santa invites Jack and Dylan to accompany him. During the successful run, Callum watches Jack regain his wonder and build a relationship with Dylan. With his faith restored, Callum decides against retiring.\\nCast\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDwayne Johnson\\nas Callum \\\"Cal\\\" Drift, head of North Pole security for Saint Nicholas\\nChris Evans\\nas Jack O'Malley, a hacker and bounty hunter\\nLucy Liu\\nas Zoe Harlow, the Director of MORA\\nKiernan Shipka\\nas\\nGr\\u00fdla\\n, a Christmas witch who captures Santa Claus\\nBonnie Hunt\\nas\\nMrs. Claus\\n, the wife of Santa Claus\\nKristofer Hivju\\nas\\nKrampus\\n, the brother of Santa and the ex-boyfriend of Gr\\u00fdla\\nNick Kroll\\nas Ted\\nJ.

Instead of the traditional championship model, the UFC held tournaments with the winner receiving a permanent appellation.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nIn\\nresponse to criticism\\nfrom Senator\\nJohn McCain\\nthat saw the loss of its television deal and the banning of the sport in thirty-six states, the UFC increased its cooperation with state athletic commissions and introduced weight classes in 1997, starting with\\nUFC 12\\n, and began introducing weight-specific titles.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nThe original codification for weight classes introduced only two divisions:\\nheavyweight\\n, which grouped together all competitors above 200 pounds (91\\u00a0kg), and\\nlightweight\\n, which encompassed all competitors 199 pounds (90\\u00a0kg) and under.

Fighters with multiple championship wins have each championship counted for the total. There is a distinction between the total number of championships won by a nationality and the number of individual fighters that won them. Division championships are the primary separation criteria due to being non-closed competition. It includes title holders and interim title holders. Countries that are tied are separated by number of individual champions. Interim champions who become undisputed champions are listed only once. Tournament championships are secondary due to many tournaments being country-specific and thus not generally a national achievement to win.

Each type of government has a different distribution of power and different responsibilities between the mayor and the city council. The types of government are:\\nStrong mayor\\n:\\nThe city council serves as the city's primary legislative body, and the mayor serves as the city's chief executive.\\nCouncil-manager\\n:\\nAn elected city council\\u2014which includes the mayor and serves as the city's primary legislative body\\u2014appoints a chief executive called a city manager to oversee day-to-day municipal operations and to implement the council's policy and legislative initiatives.\\nCity commission\\n:\\nA city council, composed of an elected mayor and a board of elected commissioners, serves as the city's primary legislative and administrative body.\\nHybrid:\\nThe city council serves as the city's primary legislative body, and the mayor serves as the city's chief executive. The mayor, however, appoints a city manager to oversee the city's day-to-day operations and to implement city policies.\\nNote\\n: In cities where mayoral elections are nonpartisan, Ballotpedia uses one or more of the following sources to identify each officeholder's partisan affiliation: (1) direct communication from the officeholder, (2) previous candidacy for partisan office, or (3) identification of partisan affiliation by multiple media outlets.\\n100 Largest Cities By Population\\nRank\\nCity\\nPopulation (2020)\\nMayor\\nTook office\\nTerm ends\\nGovernment type\\nMayoral election in 2025?\\n1\\nNew York, New York\\n8,804,190\\nEric Adams\\n2022\\n2026\\nStrong mayor\\nYes\\n2\\nLos Angeles, California\\n3,898,747\\nKaren Bass\\n2022\\n2026\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n3\\nChicago, Illinois\\n2,746,388\\nBrandon Johnson\\n2023\\n2027\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n4\\nHouston, Texas\\n2,304,580\\nJohn Whitmire\\n2024\\n2028\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n5\\nPhoenix, Arizona\\n1,608,139\\nKate Gallego\\n2019\\n2029\\nCouncil-manager\\nNo\\n6\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\\n1,603,797\\nCherelle Parker\\n2024\\n2028\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n7\\nSan Antonio, Texas\\n1,434,625\\nGina Ortiz Jones\\n2025\\n2027\\nCouncil-manager\\nYes\\n8\\nSan Diego, California\\n1,386,932\\nTodd Gloria\\n2020\\n2028\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n9\\nDallas, Texas\\n1,304,379\\nEric Johnson\\n2019\\n2027\\nCouncil-manager\\nNo\\n10\\nSan Jose, California\\n1,013,240\\nMatt Mahan\\n2023\\n2029\\nCouncil-manager\\nNo\\n11\\nAustin, Texas\\n961,855\\nKirk Watson\\n2023\\n2029\\nCouncil-manager\\nNo\\n12\\nJacksonville, Florida\\n949,611\\nDonna Deegan\\n2023\\n2027\\nStrong mayor\\nNo\\n13\\nFort Worth, Texas\\n918,915\\nMattie Parker\\n2021\\n2027\\nCouncil-manager\\nYes\\n14\\nColumbus, Ohio\\n905,748\\nAndrew J.

Jones used his wrestling to dominate Hamill, but was disqualified for the use of illegal\\n12\\u20136 elbows\\n.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nThe\\nUnified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\\nprohibited downward elbow strikes, and Jones was initially only penalized a point from the round. However, Hamill was unable to continue due to his dislocated shoulder.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nConsequently, the replay simulation was reviewed, and showed that Jones's elbows further damaged Hamill's already bloody and lacerated nose. This marked the first time that Nevada has used its recently enacted instant replay rule, in which the referee's decision was supported by the commission, which utilized a slow-motion replay to review the elbows.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nUFC president\\nDana White\\nwas aggrieved that referee Steve Mazagatti ruled the bout as a\\ndisqualification\\n, which resulted in a loss for Jones, saying that it should have been a\\nno contest\\n.\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nIn 2019, White said he was still attempting to have the result overturned to a no contest by the\\nNevada State Athletic Commission\\n.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nJones fought\\nBrandon Vera\\non March 21, 2010, at\\nUFC Live: Vera vs. Jones\\n.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nJones won the fight by TKO.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nThe elbow delivered to stop the fight also broke Vera's face in three places.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nJones also won the \\\"Knockout of the Night\\\" award.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nJones and basketball player\\nGlen Davis\\nin 2010\\nJones defeated former\\nIFL Light Heavyweight\\nChampion\\nVladimir Matyushenko\\nby TKO with elbows in 1:52 of the first round on August 1, 2010, at\\nUFC Live: Jones vs. Matyushenko\\n.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nDana White promised Jones a \\\"huge step-up in the competition\\\", if he managed to defeat Matyushenko.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nFollowing the match with Matyushenko, White said, \\\"Vladimir Matyushenko is a guy who I have a lot of respect for and I didn't think it was going to happen that easy. Jones is the real deal and he just catapulted himself tonight into the top eight in the world. Tonight solidified it. ...

Jones was awarded the \\\"Submission of the Night\\\" bonus.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nLight Heavyweight Champion\\nImmediately after the bout with Bader, it was revealed that title contender and Jones's training partner\\nRashad Evans\\nhad sustained a knee injury in training, and would not be able to compete in his scheduled match with UFC light heavyweight champion\\nMaur\\u00edcio \\\"Shogun\\\" Rua\\n. Jones was told by\\nJoe Rogan\\nin the post-fight interview that he would replace Evans in the fight for the\\nUFC Light Heavyweight Championship\\n.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nOn March 19, 2011, at\\nUFC 128\\n, Jones defeated Rua by TKO at 2:37 of Round 3, becoming the youngest ever UFC champion. After an early flying knee that badly hurt the champion, Shogun was dominated throughout the three rounds.

That's what you saw [against] Teixeira, but to say I am purposely poking people in the eye, it's just inaccurate.\\\"\\n[\\n245\\n]\\nIn 2017, the Unified Rules were amended to prohibit extension of a fighter's fingers towards the eyes of an opponent.\\n[\\n246\\n]\\nDaniel Cormier altercation\\nDuring a promotional event for UFC 178, on August 4, 2014, Jones and\\nDaniel Cormier\\nbriefly scuffled during an on-stage staredown, initiated by Jones pressing his forehead against Cormier's forehead, prompting Cormier to shove Jones by the throat, to which Jones responded by throwing a punch.\\n[\\n247\\n]\\nBoth fighters were restrained by coaches and event organizers. Later that day during a press conference, Cormier expressed a desire to spit in Jones' face, to which Jones responded by threatening to kill Cormier.\\n[\\n248\\n]\\nUFC chief legal officer Kirk Hendrick said \\\"there are going to be ramifications\\\". In addition, the Nevada State Athletic Commission requested a video copy of the altercation.\\n[\\n249\\n]\\nOn September 23, 2014, Jones was fined $50,000 and was ordered to undergo 40 hours of community service by the\\nNevada Athletic Commission\\n.\\n[\\n250\\n]\\nDuring the disciplinary hearing, Jones claimed to have lost a six-figure endorsement deal with Nike, but later admitted to fabricating the statement.\\n[\\n251\\n]\\n[\\n252\\n]\\nLegal issues\\nHit-and-run conviction\\nOn April 27, 2015,\\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\\n, police stated that Jones was sought in connection with a\\nhit and run\\nearly the previous morning. Jones was alleged to have run a red light and crashed his rental car in a collision involving two other vehicles. Jones allegedly fled the scene of the crash on foot, leaving an injured pregnant woman behind in another vehicle. The incident was witnessed by an off-duty police officer who identified the suspect as an African-American man, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, whom he believed to be Jones.\\n[\\n253\\n]\\n[\\n254\\n]\\nAccording to witnesses, the man described as Jones then returned to the scene to grab cash from the vehicle before fleeing again. Paperwork found in the rental car was under the name of \\\"Jonathan Jones\\\". Inside the silver Buick SUV, law enforcement found a pipe with\\nmarijuana\\ninside of it.\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nThough initially wanted for questioning that could have resulted in a simple\\nmisdemeanor\\n, Jones's charges were elevated to a\\nfelony\\non April 27 for injuring a person and purposely\\nleaving the scene of an accident\\n.\\n[\\n256\\n]\\nAn arrest warrant was issued against Jones, and surrender arrangements were made between law enforcement and Jones's lawyers.\\n[\\n257\\n]\\nThat evening, Jones turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police Department.\\n[\\n258\\n]\\nLater that evening, he posted bail of $2,500 and left the Bernalillo County Metro Detention Center.\\n[\\n259\\n]\\nHe made a court appearance on April 28 and did not enter a plea. The judge lifted any travel restrictions, and Jones was allowed to remain free, as long as he remained in contact with his lawyer and followed certain conditions.\\n[\\n260\\n]\\nWith a pending UFC fight still in his contract, UFC President\\nDana White\\nand\\nZuffa\\nowner\\nLorenzo Fertitta\\ntraveled to New Mexico from Las Vegas to meet with Jones in person. That same day, the UFC stripped Jones of the title, removed him from official rankings, and suspended him indefinitely.\\n[\\n261\\n]\\nIn a statement released that day, the UFC announced that Jones was stripped from his belt for violating the Athlete Code of Conduct Policy.\\n[\\n262\\n]\\nJones apologized to his fans on Twitter by saying, \\\"Got a lot of soul searching to do. Sorry to everyone I've let down.\\\"\\n[\\n263\\n]\\nOn September 29, 2015, he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was subsequently sentenced to up to 18 months of supervised probation. He was authorized to travel for work-related purposes. Jones met all of the conditions, which included 72 separate appearances for charity or youth outreach, avoiding a felony charge on his criminal record.\\n[\\n264\\n]\\nIn an interview in December 2016, Jones admitted he had run from the scene of the accident and had not checked on the occupant of the other vehicle.\\n[\\n265\\n]\\nDomestic violence arrest\\nIn the early hours of September 24, 2021, a day after Jones was inducted into the\\nUFC Hall of Fame\\nfor his fight with\\nAlexander Gustafsson\\nat\\nUFC 165\\n, police were called to the\\nCaesars Palace\\nresort hotel in\\nLas Vegas\\n,\\nNevada\\n, responding to a domestic incident. According to a police report obtained by news site\\nMMA Fighting\\n, a\\n9-1-1\\ncall was made by a hotel security guard when Jones's youngest daughter requested help, saying there was a domestic incident between Jones and his fianc\\u00e9e, Jessie Moses. Police arrived, cutting Jones off as he was attempting to flee. When investigating the room, they observed Moses with blood on her face and clothing, and with a bump on her lip. Moses said that Jones had left the hotel to go out with friends, and when he returned, he became agitated and pulled her hair. She said that the hair pulling was the extent of the physicality between the two, and that the blood on her face and clothing was from chapped lips. She also declined a temporary protective order against Jones. Police stated that while Jones was being detained, he headbutted the hood of the patrol vehicle and made threats, saying he could break free from the handcuffs. Jones was arrested after the investigation, taken to\\nClark County\\njail, and was charged with one count of\\ndomestic\\nbattery\\n, a misdemeanor, and one count of tampering with a police vehicle, a felony. His bail was set at $16,000.\\n[\\n266\\n]\\n[\\n267\\n]\\nJones posted bail approximately twelve hours after his arrest and was due to be arraigned in court on October 26.\\n[\\n268\\n]\\nFour days after his arrest, Jones posted an\\nInstagram\\nvideo of himself lifting weights, with the caption saying \\\"I have way too much trauma to consume alcohol, my brain simply can't handle it anymore. I will leave alcohol in my past forever.\\\"\\n[\\n269\\n]\\nThree weeks after the arrest, Jones was banned from entering\\nJackson Wink MMA\\ngym by his coach, Mike Winkeljohn, where Jones had been training since 2009.\\n[\\n270\\n]\\nOn December 16, it was revealed that the domestic battery charge against Jones was dropped. As for the felony tampering with a police vehicle charge, Jones pleaded\\nno contest\\nand was ordered to pay $750 in restitution, attend anger management therapy, and was given a court order to stay out of any and all legal trouble.\\n[\\n271\\n]\\nOther legal troubles\\nIn the early morning of May 19, 2012, Jones drove his\\nBentley Continental GT\\ninto a pole in\\nBinghamton, New York\\n. Jones was arrested for\\ndriving under the influence\\n(DUI) and was bailed out by his mother.\\n[\\n272\\n]\\nHe pleaded guilty to DUI charges and was order to pay a $1,000 fine, install\\nignition interlocks\\non all of his vehicles, complete a victims impact class, and had his driver's license suspended for six months.\\n[\\n273\\n]\\nOn July 21, 2019, it was reported that Jones had been charged with battery for an alleged incident in April 2019 involving a cocktail waitress at a strip club in\\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\\n. The waitress claimed that Jones slapped her, put her in a choke hold and kissed her on the neck, and touched her after she had asked him to stop.\\n[\\n274\\n]\\n[\\n275\\n]\\nThe bench trial of the case was held on September 26, 2019,\\n[\\n276\\n]\\nwhere Jones pleaded no contest to the charges and received a 90-day deferred sentence whereby he must avoid arrest, not violate the law, consume no alcohol or drugs and not return to the scene. He was also ordered to pay court fees during his unsupervised probation period, as per the court document.\\n[\\n277\\n]\\nJones was arrested in the early morning of March 26, 2020, in Albuquerque.\\n[\\n278\\n]\\nAccording to police reports, an Albuquerque PD officer heard what sounded like a gunshot and, upon further investigation, observed a black Jeep with Jones in the driver's seat. After noticing signs of intoxication, the responding officer administered a field sobriety test, which Jones failed. Jones was also given a breathalyzer test and registered a\\nBAC\\nmore than twice the legal limit. Police then searched Jones's vehicle while arresting him for DWI and found a partially empty bottle of\\nRecuerdo Mezcal\\nas well as a black handgun underneath the driver's seat. Jones was arrested on the scene and taken to the\\nBernalillo County\\njail. Altogether, Jones was charged with aggravated DWI, negligent use of a firearm, possession of an open container, and driving with no proof of insurance.\\n[\\n279\\n]\\nOn March 31, it was announced that Jones had pleaded guilty to the DWI charge, after accepting a\\nplea deal\\nin which the other charges would be dropped. He was sentenced to four days' house arrest, one year of supervised probation, a minimum of 90 days of outpatient therapy, and he must complete 48 hours of community service.\\n[\\n280\\n]\\nOn March 30, 2024, Crystal Martinez, a drug-testing agent from Drug Free Sport filed a police report stating that Jones allegedly assaulted her and threatened to kill her during a recent visit to his home when she was tasked with collecting a urine sample as part of the UFC's anti-doping program.\\n[\\n281\\n]\\nOn April 7, 2024, Albuquerque Police Department issued Jones a summons citing assault and interference with communications offenses.\\n[\\n282\\n]\\nIn July 2024, Jones pled not guilty to both misdemeanor charges, with bench trial being set to take place on August 22. Subsequently the trial was postponed until September 26 due to the police officer that responded to the incident could not attend on the original date.\\n[\\n283\\n]\\nOn October 29, 2024, Jones agreed to attend four hours of anger management classes to resolve charges.\\n[\\n284\\n]\\nOn June\\u00a017,\\u00a02025, a criminal summons was filed in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, accusing Jones of a misdemeanor charge for allegedly fleeing the scene of a traffic accident that occurred on February\\u00a024. Albuquerque police responded to a crash involving a woman in the passenger seat who was \\\"significantly intoxicated and lacking clothing from the waist down.\\\" She stated Jones had been driving and fled on foot. The woman called Jones afterward, during which police allege he appeared heavily intoxicated, refused to confirm his identity, and made statements \\\"implying his capacity to employ lethal force through third parties.\\\" He is scheduled to appear at a July\\u00a024 bond arraignment,\\n[\\n285\\n]\\nand his bench trial was set for September 2, 2025.\\n[\\n286\\n]\\nNew Mexico prosecutors dismissed misdemeanor charges.\\n[\\n287\\n]\\nFailed drug tests\\nUFC 182\\nOn January 6, 2015, it was announced that Jones failed a drug test prior to\\nUFC 182\\n. He tested positive for\\nbenzoylecgonine\\n, the primary metabolite of\\ncocaine\\n.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nBecause benzoylecgonine is not banned out-of-competition by the\\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency\\n(WADA), the NSAC could not halt Jones from participating during UFC 182. He was randomly tested on December 3, 2014, and results came back on December 23. A week after his first test, Jones was tested again. He passed the second test, which meant that the cocaine metabolite was out of his system before the fight. When the news was made public, Jones went into rehab for one night.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\n[\\n288\\n]\\n[\\n289\\n]\\nHe was fined $25,000 on January 17 for violating the UFC's Athlete Code of Conduct policy.\\n[\\n290\\n]\\nOn January 19, 2015, Jones was interviewed for the first time since the failed drug test and said: \\\"...I'm not a cocaine addict by any means or not even a frequent user. I just made a really dumb decision and got caught with my pants down in this whole situation.\\\"\\n[\\n291\\n]\\nPrior to his UFC 182 bout with Cormier, Jones's\\ntestosterone\\n/\\nepitestosterone\\n(T/E) ratio was considered by some experts to be alarmingly low.\\nVictor Conte\\n, a former steroid distributor, who founded and led the\\nBay Area Laboratory Co-operative\\n(BALCO), said of Jones's test \\\"these (levels) are highly suspicious for Jon Jones, in my opinion. This is the reason that sophisticated anti-doping officials do target testing. So based on what we see here, my opinion is Jon Jones should be on a very short leash and should be random tested here until they sort out why he has these anomalies.\\\"\\n[\\n292\\n]\\nThis resulted in several journalists imploring the NSAC to utilize CIR (Carbon Isotope Ratio) testing on Jones's samples. \\\"Luckily, this is a situation where speculation could quickly be ended. Jon Jones's drug test samples still exist and a simple Carbon Isotope Ratio test could be conducted to find the result. Put simply, a CIR test would be able to determine if the testosterone in Jones's system was synthetic or natural,\\\" Brent Brookhouse of Bloody Elbow wrote.\\n[\\n293\\n]\\nHowever, according to NSAC executive director Bob Bennett, Jones's test samples had already undergone CIR testing by the same WADA-accredited lab which had reported his T/E ratios, noting that all CIR results came back clean.\\n[\\n294\\n]\\nAdditionally, he said there were three different types of tests done during each of the random tests: urine, blood testing for human growth hormone and a blood passport test. \\\"The only negative was testing positive for cocaine metabolites,\\\" Bennett said.\\n[\\n295\\n]\\nUFC 200\\nOn July 8, 2016, a urine sample from Jones tested positive for two banned substances,\\nclomiphene\\n, an anti-estrogen substance, and\\nletrozole\\n, an aromatase inhibitor, prior to his scheduled championship bout with Cormier at\\nUFC 200\\n. The violation was from an \\\"A\\\" sample collection on June 16, with subsequent testing of the B sample confirming the doping. Both drugs, which are on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned substances list, are described as \\\"hormone and metabolic modulators\\\", which are not allowed to be used in or out of competition.\\n[\\n296\\n]\\n[\\n297\\n]\\nAs a result, Jones had to withdraw from the event, and was replaced by former middleweight champion\\nAnderson Silva\\n.\\n[\\n298\\n]\\nThroughout the ordeal, Jones maintained his innocence, claiming that he was the victim of a contaminated product that he believed to be Cialis, which was later independently obtained, tested and found to be contaminated by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\\n[\\n299\\n]\\nOn November 7, 2016, it was announced that Jones was issued a one-year suspension by USADA following his arbitration hearing, though the panel concluded that Jones did not take the banned substances intentionally, and was not a drug cheat.\\n[\\n300\\n]\\nUFC 214\\nOn August 22, 2017, it was announced that Jones was flagged for a potential doping violation by USADA, stemming from his test sample that was collected on July 28, one day before his rematch against Cormier at\\nUFC 214\\n. He tested positive for\\nTurinabol\\n, an\\nanabolic steroid\\n, and was placed on a provisional suspension as a result of the positive drug test.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nOn September 13, the CSAC announced that it had overturned the result of the fight with Cormier from a KO victory for Jones to a 'no contest', after both Jones's A and B samples tested positive for Turinabol. Jones was also stripped of the title for a third time, and it was then returned to Cormier.\\n[\\n301\\n]\\nJones stated that he did not knowingly take any prohibited substances,\\n[\\n302\\n]\\nwith his team believing Jones consumed tainted substances. Jones potentially faced up to a 4-year suspension if found guilty,\\n[\\n303\\n]\\nbut on September 18 he was handed a 15-month suspension by USADA, retroactive to July 28,\\n[\\n304\\n]\\nplus three months community service.\\n[\\n305\\n]\\nThirty months were deducted from the four-year suspension because Jones provided \\\"substantial assistance\\\" to USADA. \\\"Substantial assistance\\\" refers to an athlete informing an anti-doping agency about a doping violation by another athlete.\\n[\\n306\\n]\\nUSADA said it reduced the suspension by a further three months after a hearing with an independent arbitrator, Richard McLaren, on September 15.\\n[\\n304\\n]\\nTravis Tygart\\n, CEO of USADA, said in a statement: \\\"The independent arbitrator found that Jon Jones was not intentionally cheating in this case, and while we thought 18 months was the appropriate sanction given the other circumstances of the case, we respect the arbitrator's decision and believe that justice was served. This case is another strong reminder that athletes need to be extremely cautious about the products and supplements they use to ensure they are free of prohibited substances.\\\"\\n[\\n307\\n]\\nUFC 232\\nJones became eligible to fight again on October 28, 2018,\\n[\\n308\\n]\\nand was scheduled to fight against\\nAlexander Gustafsson\\nat\\nUFC 232\\nin Las Vegas on December 29. However, after further inconsistencies arose with his drug test on December 23, he was not granted a license to compete in Nevada, so the event was moved to Los Angeles.\\n[\\n309\\n]\\nIn order to receive a license from CSAC, Jones had to enroll into the VADA (Voluntary Anti-Doping Association) testing program, thus making him the first UFC fighter to be signed to both USADA and VADA testing programs simultaneously.\\n[\\n310\\n]\\nDrug tests administered at UFC 232 found an ultra trace amount of turinabol, which doctors attributed to a long-term \\\"pulsing effect\\\" of the M3 metabolite detected in 2017. CSAC did not take disciplinary action against Jones as the medical experts stated that there was no evidence that Jones had re-administered a banned substance and no performance-enhancing benefits were gained.\\n[\\n311\\n]\\nChampionships and accomplishments\\nJon Jones with fans at UFC 100 Fan Expo, Mandalay Bay Casino, Las Vegas\\nMixed martial arts\\nUltimate Fighting Championship\\nUFC

Harrell praised Diaz in the press\\nconference.[86] In October 2024, Diaz was placed on paid leave during watchdog\\ninvestigations into 51 allegations against him and the department.[87] In\\nDecember 2024, Harrell fired Diaz after an internal investigation found that\\nDiaz had hired and directly supervised a romantic partner and attempted to\\ncover it up.[88] In May 2025, Diaz filed a lawsuit against the city over\\nwrongful termination and discrimination, after he came out as gay.[89]\\n\\nHarrell named his niece and former campaign manager Monisha Harrell as senior\\ndeputy mayor in 2021, becoming the first black, openly gay deputy mayor in\\nSeattle history.[90][91] She resigned the position in 2023, stating her\\ndeparture was amincable and over disagreements on public safety issues.[92] In\\n2025, Monisha Harrell stated her departure was due to a toxic workplace\\nagainst her and other women in the office.[91] In 2025 Monisha Harrell spoke\\nto [KUOW](/wiki/KUOW-FM \\\"KUOW-FM\\\") to allege that Harrell had created a toxic\\nwork environment where he repeatedly undermined the authority of the women\\nstaffers, including herself.[91][93] Six other anonymous women with ties to\\nthe Mayor's office were interviewed by KUOW, supporting Monisha Harrell's\\ncharacterizations of the work environment.[91]\\n\\n#### Public Safety\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=18 \\\"Edit section:\\nPublic Safety\\\")]\\n\\nThroughout his term, Harrell focused on increasing staffing within the Seattle\\nPolice Department (SPD) by 500 officers through higher pay and recruitment\\nbonuses.[94] In the first quarter of 2025, SPD saw a 500% increase in\\napplications compared to the same period in 2024.[95] In July 2025, the city\\nannounced that 100 new officers were hired in the first half of the year.[96]\\n\\nIn the first month of his term, Harrell launched \\\"Operation New Day,\\\" starting\\nby expanding police presence in the [Little Saigon\\nneighborhood](/wiki/Little_Saigon,_Seattle \\\"Little Saigon, Seattle\\\"), which\\nhad experienced increased crime and public drug use since the start of the\\n[COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \\\"COVID-19 pandemic\\\").[97] In his\\nFebruary State of the City speech, Harrell vowed to clean-up crime in Little\\nSaigon and touted that early success of the program in the neighborhood,\\nstating \\\"...police officers in the first 21 days of January made 23 felony\\narrests, 14 misdemeanor arrests.\\\"[98][99] By March 2022, the drug market and\\nillegal goods market were cleared due to daily police patrols, and the program\\nwas expanded to other \\\"hotspots\\\" in the city, including Downtown, due to it\\n\\\"sucessfully\\\" working in Little Saigon.[97][99][100]\\n\\nBy fall 2023, arrests for public drug use and dealing, along with daily\\npatrols, tappered off, leading to a renewed surge in crime in Little\\nSiagon.[101][102] In November 2024, in response to a mass stabbing event in\\nLittle Saigon, Harrell announced increased police patrols, plans to install\\nCCTV cameras, and signed an executive order aimed at discouraging \\\"illegal\\nvending.\\\"[103][104]\\n\\nIn May 2025, Harrell and Seattle Police put online the Real Time Crime Center\\n(RTCC), which monitor video and data streams to assist in addressing public\\nsafety.[105] The RTCC would use information collected from a pilot program of\\nCCTV cameras in high crime neighborhoods, including the Chinatown Internation\\nDistrict, Downtown, and Aurora Avenue.[105] Although some citizens expressed\\nprivacy concerns, Harrell pushed for an expansion of the program in nightlife\\nareas, the stadium district, and [Garfield High\\nSchool](/wiki/Garfield_High_School_\\\\(Seattle\\\\) \\\"Garfield High School\\n\\\\(Seattle\\\\)\\\").[106][107]\\n\\n#### Housing\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=19 \\\"Edit section:\\nHousing\\\")]\\n\\nIn August 2022, as Harrell was implementing and pushing his \\\"One Seattle''\\nplan to fight homelessness, excerpts from a meeting with the Seattle Police\\nDepartment were leaked to the radio station 770 KTTH.[108] In the leaks, he\\nsaid that \\\"no one has a right to sleep on the streets\\\" and that the\\n\\\"authority\\\" was \\\"working against\\\" his efforts to address homelessness,\\ncriticized the King County Regional Homelessness Authority, and vowed to work\\nagainst \\\"inexperienced\\\" City Council members.[109] After the leak, he\\nacknowledged his previous comments, and did not disavow them, but used what\\nthe _Seattle Times_ characterized as more diplomatic language. Harrell\\nasserted that he had a right to \\\"criticize what he sees\\\" but that he would\\nspeak with individuals who might be offended by his leaked remarks. Lisa\\nDaugaard, the director of the Public Defender Association and overseer of the\\n[Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion](/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Assisted_Diversion\\n\\\"Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion\\\") (a program to provide care for those who\\nbreak the law due to extreme poverty), said that the program's relationship\\nwith Harrell was still \\\"in good shape\\\".[109]\\n\\nIn July 2022, the Pacific Northwest experienced a historic heat wave that\\nbrought dangerously high temperatures to Seattle. Harrell's administration\\nfaced harsh criticism for continuing to remove homeless encampments during the\\nheat wave.[110] Harell's administration removed over 8,000 tents in 2023 and\\n2024, breaking records for number of houseless sweeps performed while shelter\\ncapacity was reduced over the same period,[111] exacerbating community concern\\naround housing access and public safety.[112]\\n\\nIn 2023, Harrell sought to limit the applicability of a new Washington state\\nlaw that permitted the construction of fourplexes and sixplexes in zones\\npreviously zoned exclusively for single-family housing. The state law was\\nintended to increase housing construction amid a housing shortage. In\\nexplaining Harrell's attempt to limit density and new housing construction,\\nhis spokesperson cited concerns over [gentrification](/wiki/Gentrification\\n\\\"Gentrification\\\") and displacement.[113]\\n\\nIn February 2025, Seattle held a special election to determine funding for a\\n[social housing](/wiki/Social_housing \\\"Social housing\\\") project that voters\\nhad approved in an earlier election. Harrell, alongside business leaders,\\nendorsed Proposition 1B, a proposal to use existing tax revenue to fund this\\nhousing, while progressive leaders endorsed Proposition 1A, a proposal to\\ncreate a new business tax dedicated to funding social housing. Proposition 1A\\nwas victorious, a particularly significant loss for Harrell since it came\\nafter he had launched his reelection campaign.[114][115]\\n\\n#### Budget\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=20 \\\"Edit section:\\nBudget\\\")]\\n\\nIn September 2024, Harrell released an $8 billion bi-annual budget proposal\\nfor 2025\\u20132026.[116] The proposal included a 14% increased to public safety\\nprograms, 9% increase to arts and culture, and .8% increase to affordable\\nhousing projects.[117] To address a $250 million budget deficit, Harrell\\nproposed using additional Jumpstart Payroll Expense Tax fund, while cutting\\n159 city jobs.[117] In November 2024, Harrell signed the budget passed by the\\ncity council.[118]\\n\\nIn June 2025, Harrell and councilmember [Alexis Mercedes\\nRinck](/wiki/Alexis_Mercedes_Rinck \\\"Alexis Mercedes Rinck\\\") announced a\\nreworking of the city's Business and Operations tax to raise revenues by\\ntaxing large corporations while eliminating the tax on small businesses.[119]\\nIn August 2025, the city council unanomously passed the proposal which voters\\nwill vote to approve in the November general election.[120]\\n\\n#### Transportation\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=21 \\\"Edit section:\\nTransportation\\\")]\\n\\nIn July 2022, Harrell's administration reversed a decision made by former\\nmayor [Jenny Durkan](/wiki/Jenny_Durkan \\\"Jenny Durkan\\\") to allow the\\nDepartment of Transportation to issue parking violation tickets instead of the\\nSeattle Police Department. The move resulted in the cancellation of 200,000\\nparking tickets issued by the Department of Transportation, with Seattle\\nvowing to refund nearly $5 million to those who had paid the fines.[121]\\n\\nIn May 2024, Harrell proposed a $1.45 billion transportation levy, the largest\\nin the city's history, focusing on sidewalk construction and repairs, enhanced\\npedestrian and bicyclist connectivity to light rail stations, transit access\\nand reliability, bridge maintenance and planning, and the maintenance and\\nmodernization of Seattle's streets.[122] In the November general election,\\nvoters approved the levy, which was increased to $1.55 billion by the city\\ncouncil.[123]\\n\\n#### Climate change\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=22 \\\"Edit section:\\nClimate change\\\")]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Harrell signed Green New Deal legislation in Seattle,\\nallocating $6.5 million for climate projects in the city, including funding\\ntowards efforts to get city-owned buildings off fossil fuels by 2035.[124] In\\nApril 2025, Harrell signed an [Earth Day](/wiki/Earth_Day \\\"Earth Day\\\")\\nexecutive order focusing on updating Seattle's climate action plan and\\naccelerating emissions reductions, the first update to the climate action plan\\nwas released in 2013.[125]\\n\\n#### Immigration\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=23 \\\"Edit section:\\nImmigration\\\")]\\n\\nIn December 2024 Harrell commented on President-elect Donald Trump's [planned\\nmass deportation of illegal\\nimmigrants](/wiki/Mass_deportation_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump\\n\\\"Mass deportation of illegal immigrants in the second presidency of Donald\\nTrump\\\"), stating the importance of \\\"protecting certain communities\\\", but also\\nindicated that he would support mass deportation efforts of criminals, citing\\n\\\"certain activities coming out of the White House that we want to\\nembrace.\\\"[126]\\n\\n## Personal life\\n\\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bruce_Harrell&action=edit&section=24 \\\"Edit section:\\nPersonal life\\\")]\\n\\nHarrell and his wife Joanne married in 1992; they have three children and live\\nin [Seward Park](/wiki/Seward_Park,_Seattle \\\"Seward Park, Seattle\\\").[127]\\n\\nIn 2022, Harrell was honored by [Gold House](/wiki/Gold_House \\\"Gold House\\\")\\n(which honors those of Asian Pacific descent).

The 37-year-old saw a 20-foot birdie putt on the\\n18th hole drop agonizingly low of the hole.\\n\\n\\u201cI enjoyed every minute of it, obviously,\\u201d he said after the round. \\u201c(But I\\u2019m)\\nProbably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62. I knew what was\\nat stake. I just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a good read and\\njust broke away from the hole.\\n\\n\\u201cI went out there with a job to do today, and my job was to try to get myself\\nback in the tournament, and I definitely did that.\\u201d\\n\\n![Shane Lowry celebrates a birdie on the 13th at Valhalla on his way to a\\nrecord-equalling round of 62 at the PGA Championship.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/shane-lowry-celebrates-birdie-\\npga-championship.jpg)\\n\\nThe 2019 Open Champion\\u2019s 62 is the fifth in Major Championship history and\\ncame just two days after [Xander Schauffele became the first man to record two\\nrounds of 62](/news-and-events/majors/us-pga-championship/xander-schauffele-\\nmakes-history-as-first-man-to-record-two-rounds-of-62-in-major-golf-history/)\\nin Majors. Schauffele had previously achieved the feat at Los Angeles Country\\nClub in the 2023 US Open.\\n\\nWhile Branden Grace and Rickie Fowler led the way as the first two men to make\\n62s in Majors, Lowry and Schauffele\\u2019s performances at [Valhalla](/news-and-\\nevents/majors/us-pga-championship/valhalla-golf-club-course-guide/) are\\narguably more impressive due to the course\\u2019s higher par (71). Royal Birkdale,\\nwhere Grace made the first 62 in Major history in 2017, and Los Angeles CC,\\nwhere Fowler made the second (just minutes before Schauffele made the third)\\nboth had pars of 70.\\n\\nLowry, whose previous best score at one of the big four events had been a 63\\non his way to [victory at The Open at Royal Portrush](/news-and-\\nevents/majors/the-open-championship/shane-lowry-open-champion-interview/),\\nreached the turn in 29 having drained putt after putt on a week when he leads\\nall of the stats on the greens. A further three birdies followed as he reached\\nthe final tee in 57 blows knowing he needed to make a four on the par-5 18th\\nto take the record alone.\\n\\n![Shane Lowry grimaces as his putt for a 61 slips by.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/shane-lowry-misses-putt-\\nfor-61.jpg)\\n\\nThe Ryder Cup star found the rough from the tee, forcing him to lay up and\\nrely on his magical short game. He put his approach to 20 feet but held his\\nhead in anguish as the downhill putt turned late in its journey and came to\\nrest just inches to the left of the hole.\\n\\nPlaying alongside [Justin Rose](/equipment/witb/witb-justin-rose/), who shot a\\nseven-under 64, to give himself the chance of becoming the first Englishman to\\nwin the title since Jim Barnes in 1919, Lowry got off to a flying start,\\nmaking birdies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th holes to rocket up the\\nleaderboard.\\n\\nThe run ended at the 6th but he managed two more by the turn, taking advantage\\nof the par-5 7th before holing a 17-footer at the par-4 9th to reach the turn\\nin 29 shots.\\n\\nThe pace slowed on the back nine, but birdies at 13 and 14 briefly saw Lowry\\njump into a share of the lead. He joined the lead again with another red\\nnumber at the par-4 17th before Xander Schauffele again nipped ahead, but\\nLowry will head into Sunday with high hopes of winning his second Major title.\\nIf he does he\\u2019ll become just the fifth European to win the PGA Championship,\\njoining Barnes, Padraig Harrington, Martin Kaymer, and Rory McIlroy.\\n\\n![Shane Lowry is congratulated by Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose after\\nshooting 62 in the PGA Championship at Valhalla.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/rose-lowry-handshake-pga-\\nchampionship.jpg)\\n\\nAs well as equalling the record for the lowest Major round, Lowry joins\\nSchauffele as Valhalla\\u2019s course record holder. The previous record \\u2013 a 63 by\\nJose Maria Olazabal in the PGA Championship \\u2013 had stood for 24 years before\\nSchauffele\\u2019s first-round heroics.\\n\\n## Everything Shane Lowry said after his 62\\n\\nAfter his record-equalling round, Shane Lowry joined the media to discuss his\\n62 and hopes of lifting the Wanamaker Trophy for a first time.\\n\\nTHE MODERATOR: Shane Lowry is with us at the 106th PGA Championship. A 62\\ntoday. How would you summarize that performance?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every minute of\\nit, obviously. Probably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62.\\nI knew what was at stake. Just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a\\ngood read and just broke away from the hole. Look, I went out there with a job\\nto do today, and my job was to try to get myself back in the tournament, and I\\ndefinitely did that.\\n\\nQ. Best putting round of your career. What do you credit it to?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I don\\u2019t know, to be honest. I changed my putter at the Zurich\\nClassic, and even there like if I had have putted well, I think me and Rory\\nwould have won by a few. I feel like I\\u2019ve sort of changed up how I\\u2019ve been\\npracticing the last two weeks, sort of getting away from the technical side of\\nit and just trying to hole putts and just doing a lot of drills. But yeah,\\nit\\u2019s nice to finally see a few going in the hole because it\\u2019s been a slow year\\nfor me on the greens. It\\u2019s been nice to see it this week. Look, when I got\\nhere, I saw the greens. The greens are beautiful. They\\u2019re a nice pace to hole\\nputts. It was nice to see a few going in.\\n\\nQ. Did you have a number in mind today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I thought if I could get to double digits, that was my plan. If I\\ncould shoot 65, I felt like I\\u2019d be there\\u2013 I\\u2019d obviously need another at least\\n65 tomorrow if I did that. But that\\u2019s what I wanted to do. But obviously a few\\nbetter is nice.\\n\\nQ. It looked like a fried egg on 10 but not the normal kind. Can you walk us\\nthrough that there?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: How disappointing was that? I mean, I was on such \\u2014 you know, I\\nwas on such \\u2014 my momentum was there. I was on a good run, and I hit a great\\nsecond shot straight at the flag. Obviously just come up a few yards short.\\nBut it\\u2019s kind of where I was trying to hit it in that bunker because I knew I\\ncould get it up-and-down, and it pitched in the bunker. Obviously rolled up\\nthe face and rolled back in its pitch mark. It was interesting. And then I\\nfelt like it was just going to come out soft, and it come flying out of it.\\nBut yeah, that was disappointing. But I had a nice up-and-down there, which\\nkept me going.\\n\\nQ. I want to ask you how important is it do you feel now to put yourself in\\nthe position that you\\u2019re now in going into Sunday, and what would potentially\\na second major title mean to you to add to your glittering trophy cabinet?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Obviously you come here the start of every major championship,\\nand you know what it means to win one of theme. I\\u2019ve been fortunate to do it\\nbefore, and to win one is pretty good, but to win multiple, you\\u2019re kind of a\\nbit of a different level. Yeah, it would mean a lot to me tomorrow. Obviously,\\nlook, there\\u2019s a long way between now and that. We\\u2019ll see what Xander does and\\nCollin does on the back nine today first, and then we\\u2019ll go out tomorrow, and\\nhopefully I can -I\\u2019ll just go out and give my best. I go out and fight hard.\\nI\\u2019ve been in this position a few times before, learned from the sort of\\nOakmont and tournaments like that and brought that into Portrush, and\\nhopefully I can bring some of that with me tomorrow and just give it\\neverything.\\n\\nQ. Can you just tell me as someone who will never, ever know what it\\u2019s like to\\nline up a putt for a round of 61, what exactly is going through your mind?\\nWhat are you thinking?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I knew I just really wanted to hole it. Probably too much. Yeah,\\nit was just \\u2014 I kind of stood back and allowed myself to enjoy the moment. It\\nwas a pretty cool moment to have. It would have been a pretty cool moment to\\nkind of seal the deal and do it. But at the end of the day, I knew even if I\\ndidn\\u2019t do it that I done what I needed to do today, and I\\u2019m pretty happy with\\nthat.\\n\\nQ. With what Justin was doing on the front nine, have you ever played so well\\nand not taken the honor on the tee?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I know. I said that to him on the \\u2014 I think it was walking off\\nthe 5th green. I\\u2019m like, What am I going to have to do to get the honor off\\nyou today. Yeah, it was pretty cool out there, the two of us. He obviously had\\na great round, as well, and he\\u2019s put himself in there tomorrow, and we both\\nplayed great. It was nice to kind of bounce off each other and feed off each\\nother the whole day.\\n\\nQ. Just interested more in the psychology of that potential 61. How early was\\nthat in your mind as something that could happen, and how if at all does that\\ninfluence you?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, when you go out in 29, you think, wow, I have a good day\\ngoing here, and you have 10 that\\u2019s a pretty gettable par-5. I think when I\\nholed the putt on 14, I was like, here we go, yeah, this is a good chance. But\\nobviously 15 is a tricky hole and 16 is a tough hole. But it felt like I\\nplayed them very well. Obviously to birdie 17, that\\u2019s when I knew I just\\nreally wanted to hit a good tee shot on the last. I pushed it a little bit and\\nlaid it up, and I hit a great wedge shot, and yeah, obviously just missed the\\nputt. Yeah, it was in my mind from about 14 onwards.\\n\\nQ. It looked as if you looked straight up 18 as if you were going to hit \\u2013\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the ball was kind of sitting up in the rough. I had 170\\nyards from the fairway to the other side of the water, and I probably could\\nhave done it, but it felt like it was maybe a silly decision to go for it\\nunder the circumstances. I knew if I made 5 that I\\u2019m still in the tournament.\\nIf I made 6, I\\u2019d be livid with myself. I felt like it was probably a bit too\\nrisky to take on. I hit a poor lay-up to be honest, and I got fortunate that\\nit was in the semi-rough, and I had a perfect number from there. And I hit a\\ngreat shot then after that.\\n\\nQ. Leading up to this week, did you see anything in your game specifically\\nthat might have fore shadowed something like this? What was clicking for you?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I feel like tee-to-green, I\\u2019ve been as good as I\\u2019ve ever been\\nthis year, and then I come out the first two days, it was probably the worst\\nI\\u2019ve played in a long time, but my putter kept me going and kept me in the\\ntournament. Then I went to the range with my coach yesterday afternoon and\\nsort of \\u2014 it was just an alignment issue. I was set up too far left and all\\nsorts of bad things happen for me when I do that. Yeah, fixed that, and went\\nout there today, played with a little bit of freedom, and managed to do that\\nscore. Yeah, I\\u2019ve sort of felt all season that if I could warm my putter up\\nthat I could be dangerous. I kept saying it. Here I am going out in one of the\\nlast groups tomorrow, one of the last few groups tomorrow with a chance in\\nthis tournament. That\\u2019s nice. Regardless of what happens tomorrow, it\\u2019s a nice\\nposition to be in.\\n\\nQ. When is the last time you were this satisfied after a round? Seems like\\nthere\\u2019s a pretty good smile you can\\u2019t wipe off your face.\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: To be honest, I said to my coach, my agent after the first two\\nrounds, the last two days, I feel like I\\u2019ve gotten a lot out of my golf this\\nweek. I played poorly the first two days I felt, got a lot out of the rounds,\\nand it\\u2019s been a while since I\\u2019ve felt like that. It\\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\\nGoing to enjoy it and kind of get out tomorrow and then just try and do it\\nagain.\\n\\nQ. Were you a little surprised the leaders didn\\u2019t push out a little farther\\nyesterday afternoon, and did that give you a little jump start knowing that\\nyou weren\\u2019t as far back as you started? Then how does the mindset change\\ntomorrow after knowing you needed to go low today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Somebody asked me this question after the first \\u2014 maybe it was\\nyesterday. Like it happens every week on the PGA TOUR. Somebody goes low the\\nfirst day and everyone thinks 25-under is going to win or 20-under is going to\\nwin. It doesn\\u2019t work like that. It\\u2019s a four-round event, and it takes a lot to\\nget to the 72nd hole on Sunday. I sort of felt like they weren\\u2019t going to go\\ntoo far away. Obviously the leaders have played some really solid golf and had\\nsome really good scores, but there are a lot of difficult holes out there, as\\nwell. Albeit it\\u2019s soft and there\\u2019s not much wind, if you play good it\\u2019s\\nscorable, but if you hit a bad shot, you\\u2019re going to get in trouble. If you\\nhit an average shot you could get in trouble, as well. What am I going to \\u2014\\nwhat was the \\u2013\\n\\nQ. Tomorrow\\u2019s mindset. You go low today\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I just have to \\u2014 look, I\\u2019m going to enjoy this round. I\\u2019ll go\\nback, put my feet up tonight, have some dinner, hopefully get some sleep and\\nget out there and just fight hard tomorrow and go out and give it my best.\\n\\nQ. Following up on the question with smiling out there, was there something\\nyou took from the Zurich win that might have carried over to today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Look, it was obviously nice to win in Zurich. But if you had of\\nseen me last week, I wasn\\u2019t smiling on the golf course. It\\u2019s quite hollow when\\nyou don\\u2019t get on very well. So yeah, obviously, look, winning at the Zurich\\nClassic was great for a lot of things, FedExCup, stuff like that, just to get\\nanother win under my belt. It gives you a lot of confidence. Yeah, it was nice\\nto do that. But then you go on to the next week, and it doesn\\u2019t make a\\ndifference what you\\u2019ve done last week. I think that\\u2019s the great thing about\\nthis game. It doesn\\u2019t matter what you\\u2019ve done last week, you\\u2019ve still got next\\nweek and the week after. Look, even if I go out and win tomorrow or go out and\\nfinish 20th tomorrow, we\\u2019ve still got the Canadian Open in a couple of weeks\\nand Memorial and the U.S. Open. Still got a lot to look forward to. Yeah, it\\nwas nice to get the win at the Zurich, but you just move on quickly and get on\\nto the next event.\\n\\nQ. What\\u2019s the lowest you\\u2019ve ever shot anywhere, even if it\\u2019s not official?\\nHave you ever shot below 60?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I remember having a chance one day, and I don\\u2019t normally go out\\nand keep scores, but if I get on a run, you sort of think, I\\u2019m actually doing\\nall right here. I think I maybe shot 61 before, 60, 61, but I\\u2019ve never shot\\nbelow. Actually I\\u2019ve shot 60 before. I had a putt for a 59 before. And I\\ndidn\\u2019t make it. (Laughing).\\n\\nQ. We see a lot of guys when they\\u2019re out on the course will try to keep their\\nemotions to a minimum. I think you would be categorized as one of the more\\nemotive players in pro golf. Do you feel like it\\u2019s an asset at all that you\\nkind of wear your heart on your sleeve?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, I think I\\u2019m doing okay.

9:00 AM\\n\\nMullingar welcomed a new mayor this week as Cllr Mick Dollard was officially\\nelected to the role during a meeting of the Municipal District of Mullingar\\nKinnegad. The change in leadership marked the conclusion of Cllr Ken Glynn\\u2019s\\nterm, which he described as ending \\u201con a high\\u201d.\\n\\nIn a wide-ranging address, Cllr Glynn reflected on several key milestones\\nduring his tenure. Earlier on Monday, he took part in the ceremonial sod-\\nturning for the long-awaited Saunders Bridge pedestrian crossing with county\\ncathaoirleach, Liam McDaniel. He said the project is a vital safety\\nimprovement for the community and expressed hope that another safe crossing\\nnear Millmount would be approved soon.\\n\\nCllr Glynn also referenced ongoing traffic issues at the McDonald\\u2019s Junction,\\nsaying the recent changes implemented there would be closely monitored. \\u201cIf I\\ndon\\u2019t see clear improvement, I will be pushing for the roundabout option,\\u201d he\\nstated firmly.\\n\\nDuring his term, Cllr Glynn said he was honoured to present several local\\nheroes with Addresses of Recognition, including Milly Walsh for his promotion\\nof Mullingar, Col\\u00e1iste Mhuire for bringing home the first Leinster Colleges\\ntitle since 1983; the Mullingar First Responders, Mullingar Town Band \\u2013 and he\\nhas proposed one for Caoimhe and Aoife O\\u2019Brien of Lakeside Wheelers, who\\nparticipated in the 2024 Elite World Championships.\\n\\nA notable moment for Cllr Glynn was officiating at the opening of Murty\\nQuinn\\u2019s Military Museum at Columb Barracks. \\u201cMurty\\u2019s collection was\\nbreathtaking,\\u201d he said, urging Westmeath County Council to support a permanent\\ntown museum that could house the collection and meet the long-held aspirations\\nof the community.\\n\\nHe also didn\\u2019t shy away from criticism, particularly citing a lack of\\ncommunity consultation on projects such as the Ash Road works. \\u201cConsultation\\nis one of the greatest tools in local democracy,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut acting on that\\nconsultation is equally important.\\u201d\\n\\nLooking ahead, he noted positive developments including the upcoming launch of\\nthe Mullingar Town Bus service and renewed lobbying for the reopening of the\\nMullingar to Athlone rail line. Cllr Glynn closed by thanking council staff\\nand fellow members, and expressed his hopes that transparency and inclusive\\ncommunications would remain priorities under the new mayor.\\n\\nFollowing his address, colleagues from across the political spectrum praised\\nCllr Glynn\\u2019s leadership. Cllr David Jones noted his impartiality, while Cllr\\nNiall Gaffney called him \\u201cfantastically fair\\u201d and a great mentor for new\\ncouncillors. Cllr Alfie Devine described him as \\u201cknowledgeable and\\nforthcoming,\\u201d and Cllr Bill Collentine and Cllr Aoife Davitt both acknowledged\\nthe extensive work he had done for the town.\\n\\n**Cllr Dollard elected as mayor**\\n\\nCllr Aoife Davitt proposed the nomination of Cllr Mick Dollard for the role of\\nmayor for the year to come, highlighting his decades of experience in local\\ngovernment, starting with the Town Commission in 1984. Her motion was seconded\\nby Cllr Alfie Devine.\\n\\nIn his acceptance speech, Cllr Dollard thanked his proposer, seconder, and the\\nMullingar electorate. He paid tribute to his predecessor, Cllr Glynn, noting\\nhis strong political heritage, as his father Camillus Glynn served extensively\\nin local governance.\\n\\n\\u201cI look forward to continuing much of the work Ken initiated,\\u201d said Cllr\\nDollard. He expressed a strong desire to see a long-term blueprint for the\\ndevelopment of Mullingar and vowed to support housing, voluntary\\norganisations, and strategic funding applications. \\u201cWe will be judged not just\\ntoday, but on our activities 50 or 100 years from now,\\u201d he stated.\\n\\nCllr Dollard reaffirmed his independence, saying, \\u201cAs an independent, I\\u2019m\\ncommitted to treating everyone fairly and equally,\\u201d and pledged to work\\nconstructively with council officials and staff.\\n\\n**Cllr Collentine named deputy mayor**\\n\\nCllr Ken Glynn proposed, and Cllr Aoife Davitt seconded, the appointment of\\nCllr Bill Collentine as deputy mayor. With good humour, Cllr Glynn joked that\\nCllr Collentine could expect \\u201clots of phone calls\\u201d in his new role.\\n\\nThe meeting concluded with routine business, including the adoption of a new\\nschedule of meetings for the council.\\n\\n  * [ Municipal District of Mullingar Kinnegad ](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/municipal-district-of-mullingar-kinnegad/)\\n  * \\n\\nPublished: Thu 12 Jun 2025, 9:00 AM\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=f8c59232-b2d5-5138-bc45-c5c144f48bc8&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.795&crop_h=0.99999&width=1200&height=675&x=0.16&y=1.0E-5)SportMore\\nthan 40 runners from Harriers in Dublin Marathon8 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/more-than-40-runners-from-\\nharriers-in-dublin-marathon/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=9701ec99-7641-5d87-9263-d50661085ad6&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84428&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.06379)NewsHorseleap\\npub raises over \\u20ac6k for Alzheimer Society of Ireland9 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/horseleap-pub-raises-\\nover-e6k-for-alzheimer-society-of-ireland/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=dbebbe27-d5a0-5f3f-881e-0f945345da10&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.9997&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675)NewsPaddy\\u2019s\\n\\u2018acts of kindness and love\\u2019 will be remembered11 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/paddys-acts-of-kindness-and-\\nlove-will-be-remembered/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=b2c93291-06a1-57aa-9b0d-d689414d00cb&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.925&crop_h=0.99999&width=1200&height=675&x=0.0375&y=1.0E-5)NewsClonmellon\\nwoman reported missing now locatedGarda\\u00ed in Westmeath have said that a woman\\nwho had been reported missing has been located.14 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/118064/)\\n\\nBack to top __\\n\\n[![](https://static.ew.cmg.infomaker.io/wp-\\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/01153504/westmeath-\\nlogo-300x105.png)](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/)\\n\\n  \\nServing the people of Mullingar and north Westmeath with quality local news\\nsince 1882  \\n  \\n**Editor:** Brian O'Loughlin  \\n**Address:** Blackhall Place, Mullingar, Co.
