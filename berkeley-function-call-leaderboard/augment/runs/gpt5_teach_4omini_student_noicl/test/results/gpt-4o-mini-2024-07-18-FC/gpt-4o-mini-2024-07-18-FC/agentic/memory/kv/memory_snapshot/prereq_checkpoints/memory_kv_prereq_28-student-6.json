        "user_time_management": "User has a tight schedule and uses Google Calendar for reminders. They balance coding sessions, grocery runs, FaceTiming their dog, campus organization tasks, and online gaming. User is concerned about losing focus but sees potential motivation from romantic interest.",
        "user_crush_intent": "User really likes their crush and plans to be honest by asking her to grab coffee, expressing that they\u2019ve enjoyed working together and want to get to know her more outside of class.",
        "user_crush_reflection": "User feels it's surreal to talk about crushes in college, recognizing the stress but also the opportunity to meet interesting people. They plan to wait until after the next group meeting to ask their crush for coffee, possibly using humor to lighten the moment."

        "europe_family_trip": "User went on a family vacation to Europe last summer with their parents and sister. They flew into London, where they enjoyed classic tourist attractions like the Tower of London, the British Museum, and the London Eye. User's sister, a history buff, was excited about old artifacts and crown jewels. They saw The Phantom of the Opera in the West End, which was a highlight. After London, they took a train to Paris, where it was User's first time in France. They remembered some French from middle school but mostly got by with basic phrases. User loved the picturesque city, especially the Seine River area near Notre-Dame, enjoying croissants. They spent a day at the Louvre, which felt insufficient for the vast collection.",
        "campus_getaways": "User has done smaller getaways with roommates to state parks or nearby beach towns. They enjoy the spontaneity of packing the car with snacks and fishing rods(one roommate is into fishing) and turning up the music. They set up campsites or rent small cabins for the night. One memorable trip involved being in a remote area with poor cellphone reception, which initially frustrated them but turned into a digital detox. They hiked, told stories, and enjoyed nature, realizing the importance of stepping away from their laptop, which recharged them for programming tasks back on campus.",
        "future_trip_plans": "User is hoping to plan a big trip before graduating. They are eyeing internships in Silicon Valley for next summer and might spend a couple of weeks exploring the West Coast. They are interested in Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, drawn by the coffee, craft beer, and beautiful scenery. User plans to do a road trip through Washington and Oregon after their internship, possibly with friends who will also be interning in the Bay Area. They want to discover coastal highways, Redwood forests, and hidden beaches, viewing it as a last chance for free time before post-grad life.",
        "dog_travel_plans": "User has a family dog named Archie, a super energetic Golden Retriever who stays with their parents. They considered taking Archie on a road trip, but he hates being cooped up in a car for too long, so they left him with their uncle for that trip. User dreams of traveling in an RV or camper van with Archie, bringing him along for hikes and beach runs, envisioning it as a different type of adventure that would create amazing memories.",
        "travel_philosophy": "User values travel as an experience beyond just ticking places off a bucket list. They appreciate the lessons learned from different locales: Japan taught them reverence for tradition and efficiency, Maine reminded them of nature's beauty, and Europe opened their eyes to art and culture. Short trips near campus help them unwind and discover hidden gems. User collects postcards during their travels, which remind them of the world beyond their bedroom. They find that experiencing new places heightens their curiosity and inspires creative problem-solving in their coding projects and research ideas.",
        "future_travel_plans": "User plans to nurture their passion for travel even after graduation. They hope to land a job in computer science that allows for remote work or flexible scheduling to continue exploring. They are open to weekend trips or international flights and would love to combine coding with travel, such as working abroad or collaborating on international projects. For now, they enjoy planning future journeys in their head as a mental break from debugging code, which keeps them motivated and excited for the next phase of their life."
