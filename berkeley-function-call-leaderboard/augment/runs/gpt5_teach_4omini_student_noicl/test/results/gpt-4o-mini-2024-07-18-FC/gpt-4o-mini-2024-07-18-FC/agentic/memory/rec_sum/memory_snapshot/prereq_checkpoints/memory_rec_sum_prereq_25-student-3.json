    "memory": "User is a fourth-year Computer Science student and has observed the evolution of campus culture over the years. They have discovered various communities that contribute to making the campus feel like a second home. User regrets not joining more clubs during their freshman year due to feeling overwhelmed by the transition from high school to college and focusing on classes. They eventually realized the importance of campus experience beyond academics and joined several student organizations, including the Computer Science Society. This society hosts weekly meetups to discuss new technologies, share personal projects, and invite industry speakers. User appreciates the welcoming environment, especially for beginners, and finds it helpful to chat with fellow members about tricky concepts like concurrency or containerization.User has been attending the VR/AR Club on and off since their sophomore year, drawn in by their research in immersive analytics. The club has a hands-on approach with a VR lab in the engineering building, equipped with headsets, sensors, and quirky prototypes from past members. They host demos where members showcase their latest projects, ranging from mini-games to experimental augmented reality interfaces. User was inspired by a recent presentation of an AR tutor concept for advanced math, which provides hints or 3D demonstrations when pointing a phone at an equation. They appreciate the supportive vibe of the club and the excitement around emerging technologies.User occasionally attends events at the student-run radio station, including open-mic nights where people sing, read poetry, or perform stand-up comedy. They recall a memorable night when a quiet friend from their Distributed Systems class performed an acoustic set, showcasing a different side of his personality. User appreciates these moments that reveal more about people beyond their academic roles.User enjoys the iconic central lawn on campus, where students hang out between classes and student organizations set up booths. They appreciate the variety of clubs represented, from a cappella groups to environmental activism societies, often enticing students with freebies like stickers or candy. User's personal weakness is free pizza, which makes them more likely to sign up for mailing lists. The lawn is also the site of major campus events, including the annual Tech Fest, where project teams showcase their work through posters and live demos, attracting recruiters looking for innovative ideas.User describes campus culture as fairly collaborative, with some competition among seniors for top internships or job offers. They recall their second-year experience at a campus hackathon, where thousands of students from various backgrounds participated for 24 or 36 hours straight. The event was chaotic but exhilarating, with beginners learning GitHub and advanced teams working on complex projects like real-time image recognition. User formed a small team with casual acquaintances, and the bond they created during the all-nighter\u2014sharing stale pizza, debugging code, and cheering each other on\u2014was a unique experience. They associate this vibe with campus life, emphasizing the friendships forged through shared challenges.User has moved off-campus but recalls their first two years living in a dorm specifically for engineering majors, humorously referred to as \"The Engi-House.\" They describe legendary late-night coding sessions in the common lounge, where students worked on assignments or streamed e-sports tournaments. While the environment could get intense with stressed-out engineers fueled by energy drinks, it also fostered a supportive atmosphere where help was readily available. Beyond academics, they enjoyed potlucks, watching Netflix together, and even hosting a small talent show to unwind.User has been involved in volunteering at outreach events organized by the CS department, including a \"Tech for Good\" day where local high school students come to learn about programming and problem-solving. They help run mini-workshops on topics like web development and basic Python. User finds it rewarding to see younger students light up when they create simple games or animated webpages, recalling their own feelings of being overwhelmed by the tech world at that age. They take pride in providing a positive first experience and appreciate that such events highlight the importance of engaging with the community and inspiring the next generation in STEM fields.User notes that the campus has a lively social scene, with Greek life available, though they never joined a fraternity. They found that specialized clubs are the best way to meet people with shared interests. A friend who joined the Robotics Team found a second family there, while user has grown closer to members of the VR/AR Club and the CS Society. Their interactions go beyond academic discussions; they enjoy joking around, complaining about cafeteria food, and planning weekend trips to local hiking trails.User is about to experience Senior Week for the first time, which includes a series of events leading up to graduation, such as a formal dance, a carnival, and a day for seniors to take pictures in their caps and gowns at iconic campus landmarks. They have heard that it can be bittersweet, as it's the last hurrah before everyone goes their separate ways. Older friends who graduated last year described it as one of the best weeks of their college life, filled with laughter, nostalgia, and a sense of the journey coming to an end. User feels both excited and anxious about the experience, reflecting on the memories made over four years and the transition away from being a student.User enjoys the campus traditions, particularly the annual Rivalry Game where their sports teams compete against their biggest rival college. Even though they are not a dedicated sports fan, they love the energy on campus during that week, with students dressing in school colors, painting their faces, and parading with banners. The night before the football game features a massive pep rally with fireworks, creating an electric atmosphere. Friends gather in dorm lounges or local bars to watch the game, and celebrations can last all weekend if they win. Even in defeat, students find ways to commiserate together, making it a unifying experience for everyone, from business majors to art students to engineers.User notes that their school\u2019s e-sports team has gained official recognition, expanding the campus sports scene beyond traditional sports like basketball and football. The school now has an arena for e-sports, featuring a wide seating area and a big screen for streaming competitions live. It's common for over a hundred students to gather and cheer on the team during League of Legends or Overwatch matches. User finds it surprising that e-sports has become a legitimate campus institution, reflecting changing times and a broader definition of competition and community.User participates in the annual \"Midnight Breakfast\" event during finals week, where stressed-out students gather at the dining hall at midnight for pancakes and cereal. Professors serve food, and the school band may perform, providing a morale boost during a challenging time. User appreciates this tradition as it fosters a sense of camaraderie and reminds students that they are not alone in their anxiety about final exams. They value how such events contribute to a supportive campus culture, ensuring students have moments of fun even during high-pressure periods.User believes that campus life is what you make of it, emphasizing the importance of exploring, meeting new people, and joining clubs to enrich the experience. They acknowledge the challenge of getting lost in the workload of a demanding major like Computer Science but have found attending events, volunteering, and connecting with various communities to be rewarding. User reflects on their four years, noting that while they will remember late-night coding, they will also cherish memories of game nights in the dorm, Tech Fest presentations, hackathon adrenaline, and cheers at the Rivalry Game. They express a willingness to give tours of their favorite spots and introduce others to clubs, highlighting that there is something for everyone on campus."
