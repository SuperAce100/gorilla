That excitement and nervousness can be a sign that you care about the outcome. Just take a deep breath and remind yourself that it\u2019s a positive step.\n\n2. **Be Open to Any Outcome**: Keeping your expectations realistic is wise.

This foundation can make the conversation feel more natural and comfortable.\n\n4. **Enjoy the Moment**: When you do meet up, focus on enjoying the time together. Ask her about her interests, share your own, and let the conversation flow naturally.\n\n5. **Celebrate Your Courage**: Regardless of the outcome, take a moment to acknowledge your courage for putting yourself out there.
