    "memory": "User values friendship highly, considering their closest friends at college as a second family. After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts."
