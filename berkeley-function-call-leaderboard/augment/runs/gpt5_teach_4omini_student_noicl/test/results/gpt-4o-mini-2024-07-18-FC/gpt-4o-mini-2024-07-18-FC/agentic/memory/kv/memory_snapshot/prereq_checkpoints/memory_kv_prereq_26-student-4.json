        "job_market_aims": "User is exploring software engineering roles focused on data visualization, VR/AR technologies, and data-driven product development. They have a passion for making large datasets approachable and interactive, inspired by their research experience. They are drawn to tech companies known for innovation in data analytics and immersive technologies, such as Unity, Unreal, and specialized VR startups in healthcare or engineering. They value the advice from a lab mentor to follow the domain that excites them rather than just pursuing big-name brands.",
        "search_process": "User is currently engaged in campus recruiting, attending career fairs, and has submitted multiple applications for software engineering or data engineering intern-to-full-time conversion roles. They completed an internship at a tech startup with 9 people specializing in data analytics software for logistics companies, where they gained valuable experience in development team operations, sprint planning, code reviews, and feature rollouts. Their tasks included building UI components for an analytics dashboard and writing data pipelines for near real-time shipping event processing, which boosted their confidence and skills.",
        "grad_school_interest": "User is intrigued by the idea of pursuing grad school to continue research in immersive analytics or human-computer interaction for large datasets. They recognize that advanced degrees can lead to specialized R&D roles in industry labs or academia. Their experience writing workshop papers and working on a conference submission has shown them they enjoy deeper exploration of topics.

They feel it's a great time to enter the tech workforce, though the multitude of options can be overwhelming.",
        "growth_mindset": "User wants to keep growing their skills and avoid complacency in their career. They believe that as long as they are learning\u2014whether through new frameworks, product development approaches, or management skills\u2014they will consider their role a success. Their biggest fear is stagnation in a fast-moving field. They aim to stay curious, push their boundaries, and potentially specialize in immersive tech for data. Their next steps include finishing senior year strong, continuing interviews, evaluating offers, and making a decision by late spring. They are confident in their ability to adapt and excited about the potential paths ahead."
