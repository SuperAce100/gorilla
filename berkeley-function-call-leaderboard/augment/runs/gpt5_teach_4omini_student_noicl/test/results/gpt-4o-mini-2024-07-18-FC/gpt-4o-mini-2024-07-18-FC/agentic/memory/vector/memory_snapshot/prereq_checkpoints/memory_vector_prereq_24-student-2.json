            "5": "User's hypothesis is that VR immersion helps researchers spot anomalies or trends faster than with 2D charts. They conducted user trials with 15 participants, recording times and collecting UX questionnaire responses.",
            "6": "User is handling sections on system architecture and prototype design for the paper, while others focus on user study methodology and narrative cohesion.",
            "7": "User is balancing their research work with senior coursework and a capstone project.",
            "8": "User finds the idea of contributing to cutting-edge knowledge in areas like data visualization or machine learning tempting but wants to see how these concepts are applied in real product development.",
            "9": "User's mentor suggested that stepping into industry can provide a better perspective on relevant problems, which could lead to a more practical approach if they decide to pursue a PhD later.",
            "10": "User believes that research is about building on the foundation of what others have done, and they value the sense of collaboration within their lab and the global research community.",
