They have learned to listen to their body, take care of themselves, and appreciate the little things more. If they could give advice to their younger self, it would be to not stress about the small stuff, take care of health early, and enjoy every stage of life. User believes that getting older isn\u2019t something to fear; it\u2019s just another chapter. User has noticed that their metabolism has slowed down as they've aged. They used to be able to eat whatever they wanted, but now they find that if they're not careful, weight can creep up on them. To manage this, they focus on eating more protein, healthy fats, and fiber to keep their digestion in check. User finds that processed foods make them feel sluggish, so they try to cook most of their meals at home. One of their favorite go-to meals is grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, which they find simple, delicious, and packed with nutrients that help with inflammation. User has learned that exercise doesn't have to be intense to be effective; consistency is more important. They walk every day, rain or shine, even if it's just around their neighborhood. User has also started doing more strength training, as their doctor informed them that muscle loss accelerates with age and maintaining strength is key to preventing injuries. They use light weights and resistance bands a few times a week, which helps with their balance and joint health. User has made sleep a priority, realizing that they need a solid seven to eight hours of sleep to feel their best, compared to the five or six hours they used to manage. They have worked on their sleep hygiene by avoiding screens an hour before bed, keeping their room cool and dark, and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. User has also started taking magnesium supplements, which have helped with relaxation. They find it interesting how something as simple as getting enough sleep can significantly impact how they feel. User has become more conscious about their skin care as they've aged. They prioritize hydration and wear SPF every day, even in the winter, to prevent sun damage. User drinks a lot of water to keep their skin from feeling dry, especially during Kansas winters. They have also started using a retinol cream at night, which they learned is beneficial for maintaining healthy skin as they age. While they are not trying to look 30 again, they want to keep their skin looking and feeling good. User has recognized the importance of social connections as they've aged. They find it easy to get caught up in work, family, and responsibilities, but having a good support system significantly helps with their mental well-being. User makes it a point to have coffee with friends at least once a week and joined a book club last year, which has been a great way to stay engaged and meet new people. They believe that staying socially active keeps you young. User has noticed more moments of forgetfulness, such as misplacing their keys, compared to the past. To keep their brain sharp, they engage in activities like doing puzzles, reading, and learning new skills. User has started taking an online class on art history just for fun, which they find to be a great mental exercise. They believe that lifelong learning helps prevent cognitive decline and consider it worth pursuing. User has faced challenges managing chronic pain due to osteoarthritis, which acts up more in the colder months. They experience stiff joints on some days despite their efforts. User has found that warm baths with Epsom salts and using a heating pad in the mornings help alleviate discomfort. Their doctor recommended trying tai chi or gentle stretching, and they are looking into those options. User is learning that aging isn't about avoiding discomfort altogether but about finding ways to manage it to continue doing what they love. User has been on various medications and treatments to manage their health, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and hypothyroidism. They adjust their medications as needed and keep track of everything to avoid missing doses or mixing prescriptions. Their doctor reviews their medications every few months for potential adjustments. User has Type 2 Diabetes and has been taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily for several years, which helps keep their blood sugar in check. Their A1C hovers around 6.9%, so their doctor recently suggested adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide(Ozempic), at a low dose. User has noticed that it helps control their appetite. They regularly check their fasting blood sugar at home, which usually stays between 125-130 mg/dL. User takes losartan 50 mg once daily for high blood pressure, which keeps their readings mostly in the 135-140/80-90 mmHg range. This is a bit higher than ideal, but their doctor believes that stress management and reducing sodium intake can help instead of increasing the dosage. User also takes a daily magnesium supplement, which they have heard can help with blood pressure regulation. User's hypothyroidism has been stable on levothyroxine 75 mcg every morning. They take it on an empty stomach and wait at least 30 minutes before eating. Their last TSH test came back at 2.1 mIU/L, which is within the normal range, so their doctor hasn\u2019t changed the dosage in years. User notices that if they miss a dose, they feel sluggish the next day, so they keep a pill organizer to stay on track. User manages their osteoarthritis by taking acetaminophen as needed for mild pain. When their joints are particularly stiff, they take meloxicam 7.5 mg, an anti-inflammatory prescribed by their doctor. They do not take it every day to avoid overdoing it on NSAIDs, but it helps when their knees and hands are acting up. Their doctor also suggested trying glucosamine supplements, but they are unsure if they have made a difference. User recently adjusted their vitamin D intake due to low levels of 22 ng/mL(normal is above 30 ng/mL) from their last blood test. They now take vitamin D3 2,000 IU daily. Additionally, they take calcium supplements since their last bone density scan showed early signs of osteopenia. Their doctor recommended combining calcium with vitamin K2 to help with absorption. User takes a daily statin, atorvastatin 10 mg, to help manage their cholesterol. Their LDL was a little high at 130 mg/dL, and their triglycerides were at 140 mg/dL, so their doctor recommended a low-dose statin. So far, their cholesterol numbers have been improving, and they haven\u2019t experienced any side effects, which is a relief since some people report muscle aches with statins. User takes a daily multivitamin, omega-3 supplements for heart health, and probiotics to help with digestion. Since their gallbladder was removed a few years ago, they sometimes take digestive enzymes if they eat something heavier, as losing their gallbladder changed the way they digest fatty foods. User keeps an eye on potential medication interactions. Since they take both losartan and meloxicam occasionally, their doctor warned them that NSAIDs can sometimes affect kidney function, so they try not to take meloxicam too often. User also ensures to take their thyroid medication separately from their calcium and iron supplements, as these can interfere with absorption. User feels that their medication routine is working well for them. They stay organized with a pill planner and use reminders on their phone to keep track of everything. User focuses on lifestyle changes to avoid relying solely on medications. Their goal is to stay as healthy as possible and manage things naturally when they can to avoid unnecessary prescriptions.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

User also takes a daily magnesium supplement, which they have heard can help with blood pressure regulation. User's hypothyroidism has been stable on levothyroxine 75 mcg every morning. They take it on an empty stomach and wait at least 30 minutes before eating. Their last TSH test came back at 2.1 mIU/L, which is within the normal range, so their doctor hasn\u2019t changed the dosage in years. User notices that if they miss a dose, they feel sluggish the next day, so they keep a pill organizer to stay on track. User manages their osteoarthritis by taking acetaminophen as needed for mild pain. When their joints are particularly stiff, they take meloxicam 7.5 mg, an anti-inflammatory prescribed by their doctor. They do not take it every day to avoid overdoing it on NSAIDs, but it helps when their knees and hands are acting up. Their doctor also suggested trying glucosamine supplements, but they are unsure if they have made a difference. User recently adjusted their vitamin D intake due to low levels of 22 ng/mL(normal is above 30 ng/mL) from their last blood test. They now take vitamin D3 2,000 IU daily. Additionally, they take calcium supplements since their last bone density scan showed early signs of osteopenia. Their doctor recommended combining calcium with vitamin K2 to help with absorption. User takes a daily statin, atorvastatin 10 mg, to help manage their cholesterol. Their LDL was a little high at 130 mg/dL, and their triglycerides were at 140 mg/dL, so their doctor recommended a low-dose statin. So far, their cholesterol numbers have been improving, and they haven\u2019t experienced any side effects, which is a relief since some people report muscle aches with statins. User takes a daily multivitamin, omega-3 supplements for heart health, and probiotics to help with digestion. Since their gallbladder was removed a few years ago, they sometimes take digestive enzymes if they eat something heavier, as losing their gallbladder changed the way they digest fatty foods. User keeps an eye on potential medication interactions. Since they take both losartan and meloxicam occasionally, their doctor warned them that NSAIDs can sometimes affect kidney function, so they try not to take meloxicam too often. User also ensures to take their thyroid medication separately from their calcium and iron supplements, as these can interfere with absorption. User feels that their medication routine is working well for them. They stay organized with a pill planner and use reminders on their phone to keep track of everything. User focuses on lifestyle changes to avoid relying solely on medications. Their goal is to stay as healthy as possible and manage things naturally when they can to avoid unnecessary prescriptions.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

You should actively manage your memory data to keep track of important information, ensure that it is up-to-date and easy to retrieve to provide personalized responses to the user later.\n\nHere is the content of your memory system from previous interactions:\nUser is embracing aging and recognizes that while there are challenges, there is also wisdom that comes with experience. They have learned to listen to their body, take care of themselves, and appreciate the little things more. If they could give advice to their younger self, it would be to not stress about the small stuff, take care of health early, and enjoy every stage of life. User believes that getting older isn\u2019t something to fear; it\u2019s just another chapter. User has noticed that their metabolism has slowed down as they've aged. They used to be able to eat whatever they wanted, but now they find that if they're not careful, weight can creep up on them. To manage this, they focus on eating more protein, healthy fats, and fiber to keep their digestion in check. User finds that processed foods make them feel sluggish, so they try to cook most of their meals at home. One of their favorite go-to meals is grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, which they find simple, delicious, and packed with nutrients that help with inflammation. User has learned that exercise doesn't have to be intense to be effective; consistency is more important. They walk every day, rain or shine, even if it's just around their neighborhood. User has also started doing more strength training, as their doctor informed them that muscle loss accelerates with age and maintaining strength is key to preventing injuries. They use light weights and resistance bands a few times a week, which helps with their balance and joint health. User has made sleep a priority, realizing that they need a solid seven to eight hours of sleep to feel their best, compared to the five or six hours they used to manage. They have worked on their sleep hygiene by avoiding screens an hour before bed, keeping their room cool and dark, and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. User has also started taking magnesium supplements, which have helped with relaxation. They find it interesting how something as simple as getting enough sleep can significantly impact how they feel. User has become more conscious about their skin care as they've aged. They prioritize hydration and wear SPF every day, even in the winter, to prevent sun damage. User drinks a lot of water to keep their skin from feeling dry, especially during Kansas winters. They have also started using a retinol cream at night, which they learned is beneficial for maintaining healthy skin as they age. While they are not trying to look 30 again, they want to keep their skin looking and feeling good. User has recognized the importance of social connections as they've aged. They find it easy to get caught up in work, family, and responsibilities, but having a good support system significantly helps with their mental well-being. User makes it a point to have coffee with friends at least once a week and joined a book club last year, which has been a great way to stay engaged and meet new people. They believe that staying socially active keeps you young. User has noticed more moments of forgetfulness, such as misplacing their keys, compared to the past. To keep their brain sharp, they engage in activities like doing puzzles, reading, and learning new skills. User has started taking an online class on art history just for fun, which they find to be a great mental exercise. They believe that lifelong learning helps prevent cognitive decline and consider it worth pursuing. User has faced challenges managing chronic pain due to osteoarthritis, which acts up more in the colder months. They experience stiff joints on some days despite their efforts. User has found that warm baths with Epsom salts and using a heating pad in the mornings help alleviate discomfort. Their doctor recommended trying tai chi or gentle stretching, and they are looking into those options. User is learning that aging isn't about avoiding discomfort altogether but about finding ways to manage it to continue doing what they love. User has been on various medications and treatments to manage their health, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and hypothyroidism. They adjust their medications as needed and keep track of everything to avoid missing doses or mixing prescriptions. Their doctor reviews their medications every few months for potential adjustments. User has Type 2 Diabetes and has been taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily for several years, which helps keep their blood sugar in check. Their A1C hovers around 6.9%, so their doctor recently suggested adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide(Ozempic), at a low dose. User has noticed that it helps control their appetite. They regularly check their fasting blood sugar at home, which usually stays between 125-130 mg/dL. User takes losartan 50 mg once daily for high blood pressure, which keeps their readings mostly in the 135-140/80-90 mmHg range. This is a bit higher than ideal, but their doctor believes that stress management and reducing sodium intake can help instead of increasing the dosage.

You should actively manage your memory data to keep track of important information, ensure that it is up-to-date and easy to retrieve to provide personalized responses to the user later.\n\nHere is the content of your memory system from previous interactions:\nUser believes that success is an equation with three key variables: discipline, adaptability, and relationships. Discipline is essential for showing up every day, putting in the work, and staying consistent even in challenging times. Adaptability is crucial for navigating market shifts and industry changes, allowing one to pivot and avoid being left behind. Relationships are fundamental, as they determine how far one can go; meaningful achievements are rarely built alone. User emphasizes that every major opportunity in their career can be traced back to a relationship nurtured years earlier.User believes that one of the biggest myths about success is that it relies solely on intelligence or talent. They have worked with many brilliant individuals in finance and assert that resilience is the key differentiator between those who succeed and those who plateau. User emphasizes the importance of being able to take hits, handle rejection, and maintain confidence. They recall losing a significant deal with Intelligent Motors early in their career, which was a crushing experience. A mentor advised them that in finance, one will lose more than they win, and the key is to ensure that wins outweigh losses.

He appreciates the sleek, modern stainless-steel aesthetic of the products, which have lived up to his expectations. He has ordered multiple items, including an espresso machine, extra frothing pitchers, milk thermometers, cleaning tablets, and a digital scale, all of which he finds durable and well-constructed. He values the visual appeal of his kitchen, which now resembles a page out of a Creative Boom design magazine, aligning with his interests as a graphic designer. Michael is particularly impressed with the performance of the espresso machine, which consistently produces rich shots with great crema. He enjoys experimenting with the steam wand for latte art, although he feels his foam skills are still improving. He recently added a coffee grinder, which he describes as a game-changer for flavor and aroma. The vacuum-sealed canisters have helped him keep his beans fresher in Seattle's humid weather. Additionally, the inclusion of accessories like a digital scale has refined his home brewing process, making it more consistent.

He understands that shipping can be unpredictable, especially in Seattle's rainy weather, but the delays and confusion, such as label printing without the package leaving the warehouse, were stressful. He also experienced an issue with his first espresso machine arriving damaged, which was resolved quickly by the support team with a replacement, but it dampened his initial unboxing experience. Michael suggests improvements for account and order management, noting that managing multiple orders in quick succession can be confusing.

You should actively manage your memory data to keep track of important information, ensure that it is up-to-date and easy to retrieve to provide personalized responses to the user later.\n\nHere is the content of your memory system from previous interactions:\nUser values friendship highly, considering their closest friends at college as a second family. After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, they are taking Advanced Algorithms, a Machine Learning elective, and a project-based course on distributed systems. They enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, user listens to either a lecture recording(if they are behind) or a music playlist to help get in the zone for the day.Once at campus, user finds a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize small tasks, such as tweaking code for a morning lab or adjusting their to-do list for the day. They use a digital task manager that syncs across devices to stay organized, categorizing tasks by class or project and breaking them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. This approach helps them avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates.

They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, they are taking Advanced Algorithms, a Machine Learning elective, and a project-based course on distributed systems. They enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, user listens to either a lecture recording(if they are behind) or a music playlist to help get in the zone for the day.Once at campus, user finds a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize small tasks, such as tweaking code for a morning lab or adjusting their to-do list for the day. They use a digital task manager that syncs across devices to stay organized, categorizing tasks by class or project and breaking them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. This approach helps them avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly.

After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M.

After four years, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus, user ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software user was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: user enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, they are taking Advanced Algorithms, a Machine Learning elective, and a project-based course on distributed systems. They enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, user listens to either a lecture recording(if they are behind) or a music playlist to help get in the zone for the day.Once at campus, user finds a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize small tasks, such as tweaking code for a morning lab or adjusting their to-do list for the day. They use a digital task manager that syncs across devices to stay organized, categorizing tasks by class or project and breaking them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. This approach helps them avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

Tony is someone user can always call when feeling overwhelmed with assignments or wanting to grab pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they treat sailing strategy like a puzzle due to their shared inclination for problem-solving. Trust is essential on the water, and their team meets at odd hours to catch the best conditions, relying on each other for motivation. User feels a deep mutual respect with their sailing friends, as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging user to apply for a challenging research position in data science and supporting them with unwavering belief in their skills.As a fourth-year, user has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with others in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls bonding with Carla, another CS major, during a notoriously difficult systems programming course in their sophomore year. They became close while working on a final project to build a mini operating system kernel from scratch, sharing pizza at 3 a.m. after both struggling with memory management bugs. This experience turned into one of user\u2019s most treasured friendships.User has good friends from the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, forming a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips and workout regimens. They also game together occasionally, with Dean introducing user to a new co-op adventure game. Their friendship is built on mutual support, pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, where they spend time on weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, providing guaranteed quality time with friends. User enjoys the camaraderie of gaming in person, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and the excitement of victories. They became friends with Derek through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught user techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, user juggles advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot. Over the years, they've bumped into familiar faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to user\u2019s cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates. Jackson enjoys analyzing the political and ethical implications of new technologies, leading to discussions about algorithmic bias. Their friendship, while more intellectual than others, is valued for broadening user\u2019s perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, user complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with a mechanical engineering lab issue, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh and eventually sitting together for coffee. They bonded over academic stress, exchanged contact info, and now make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus. While she may not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, they have formed deep connections, especially due to the high workload and pressure. User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, they are taking Advanced Algorithms, a Machine Learning elective, and a project-based course on distributed systems. They enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, user listens to either a lecture recording(if they are behind) or a music playlist to help get in the zone for the day.Once at campus, user finds a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize small tasks, such as tweaking code for a morning lab or adjusting their to-do list for the day. They use a digital task manager that syncs across devices to stay organized, categorizing tasks by class or project and breaking them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. This approach helps them avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

User describes how they critique each other's code in labs and collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year, user is facing the reality of graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the day when their friends scatter to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who values time management highly and describes their daily routine as somewhat chaotic but methodical. They will share details about a typical day from start to finish.User usually wakes up around 6:30 AM, a habit formed to get a head start on projects. They sometimes sneak in an extra 15 minutes of sleep if they were up late coding or gaming. User checks their calendar on their phone first thing to prepare for the day, then does basic stretching beside their bed to avoid feeling sluggish. They believe skipping stretches leads to sluggishness for at least an hour.After a quick shower, user heads to the kitchen in their off-campus apartment, where they live with two roommates\u2014one is also a CS major, and the other is a mechanical engineering major. They usually hustle to get out the door together. If feeling ambitious, user makes scrambled eggs and spinach with whole wheat toast and brews coffee using a shared single-cup machine. If rushed, they grab a granola bar and fruit to eat on the way to campus. User aims to be economical with time while ensuring a relatively nutritious breakfast, as they are active and can't skip breakfast too often.User has strategically scheduled most of their classes in the late morning or early afternoon, with their first class typically starting at 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. This semester, they are taking Advanced Algorithms, a Machine Learning elective, and a project-based course on distributed systems. They enjoy diving into complex topics. During the 15-minute walk to campus, user listens to either a lecture recording(if they are behind) or a music playlist to help get in the zone for the day.Once at campus, user finds a seat in the student center or a quiet corner of the library to finalize small tasks, such as tweaking code for a morning lab or adjusting their to-do list for the day. They use a digital task manager that syncs across devices to stay organized, categorizing tasks by class or project and breaking them down into smaller subtasks with clear deadlines. This approach helps them avoid feeling overwhelmed by big deadlines looming weeks away.\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.
