            "1": "User's favorite class this semester is Advanced Algorithms, where they enjoy the connection between theory and real-world problem-solving. They are learning about dynamic programming and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. Their professor explains complex concepts intuitively.",
            "2": "User is taking a Distributed Systems course(CS 2631), which involves a lot of reading, group discussions, and a major project simulating a decentralized file storage system. They find the group project challenging but appreciate the real-world collaboration aspect.",
            "3": "User is taking an elective in Game Design, which counts toward their Computer Science major. They have always been a gamer and enjoy the course, taught by a professor with industry experience. They are learning about 2D and 3D engines, physics implementation, and user experience design.",
            "4": "User is taking an Introduction to Quantum Computing class, which they initially found intimidating but now enjoy. The professor emphasizes conceptual understanding over pure math, though there is significant math involved, such as linear algebra. They model basic algorithms like Grover's and Shor's.",
            "5": "User is taking a Capstone Project course, working on a project that uses machine learning to analyze social media sentiment for better emergency response. They are building an interface for city officials or campus security to see real-time alerts.",
            "6": "User is taking a humanities elective, Philosophy of Mind, which is their last required non-CS elective. They chose it for its connections to AI, discussing consciousness and its implications for artificial intelligence. The class involves a lot of discussions and helps them analyze abstract ideas."
