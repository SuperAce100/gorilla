    "memory": "User is a fourth-year Computer Science major. They are taking higher-level courses this semester, including complex algorithmic concepts, advanced system design, and basics of quantum computing. They feel it's surreal to be at this stage in their studies.User's favorite class this semester is Advanced Algorithms. They enjoy the connection between theory and real-world problem-solving, particularly in optimizing pathfinding in large networks and handling huge datasets with minimal time complexity. They are learning about dynamic programming approaches and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. User finds the class challenging but rewarding, and appreciates their professor's intuitive teaching style.User is taking a Distributed Systems course(CS 2631), which they find to be the second hardest class. The course involves a lot of reading, group discussions, and a major project simulating a decentralized file storage system. User appreciates the collaborative aspect of the project, despite challenges with different coding styles and ideas. They find it nerve-wracking at times, especially when troubleshooting bugs, but feel a sense of accomplishment when issues are resolved.User is taking an elective in Game Design, which counts toward their Computer Science major when combined with other classes. They have always been a gamer and find the course enjoyable. The professor has industry experience, having worked on indie games. The course covers basic 2D and 3D engines, physics implementation, and user experience design. User enjoys the creative assignments, such as designing a mini-game based on a labyrinth concept, focusing on balancing the difficulty curve.User is taking an Introduction to Quantum Computing class, which they initially regretted signing up for but now enjoy. The course focuses on conceptual understanding rather than pure math, although it includes a lot of linear algebra. The professor uses code examples in frameworks that simulate quantum circuits. User is learning to model basic algorithms like Grover's and Shor's, which has changed their approach to problem-solving.User is taking a Capstone Project course, which involves conceptualizing, designing, and building a software solution to solve a real problem. Their group is working on a project that uses machine learning to analyze social media sentiment for better emergency response, focusing on analyzing tweets or posts for disaster-related keywords. They are building an interface for city officials or campus security to see real-time alerts. The project integrates skills from their CS major, including database management, API building, front-end interface, and ML pipeline. They are also learning about project management and organization, with one team member acting as the Scrum Master for weekly sprints and daily stand-ups.User is taking a humanities elective, Philosophy of Mind, which is their last required non-CS elective. They chose it because it ties into AI, discussing topics like consciousness and its implications for artificial intelligence. The class is smaller, allowing for more discussions, which provides a nice change from their coding-heavy courses. User appreciates analyzing abstract ideas and exploring the ethical implications of AI systems. They recently wrote a paper on whether strong AI could ever truly experience qualia, finding the research process rewarding and important for bridging technical knowledge with ethical considerations.User's schedule includes jam-packed Mondays and Wednesdays, starting with Advanced Algorithms at 9:30 am, followed by Distributed Systems at 11:00 am. After lunch, they have a Capstone meeting that varies between lectures, lab work, and project team time. Tuesdays and Thursdays are lighter, with Quantum Computing in the morning and Game Design in the afternoon. Philosophy of Mind is on Thursday evenings, which can be tiring. Fridays are kept open for working on assignments, group projects, or labs. User also does undergrad research hours in a lab focusing on data visualization for big scientific datasets, which adds to their workload.User's biggest challenge this semester is balancing group projects, particularly the Capstone project, which can take up to ten hours a week or more if issues arise. The Distributed Systems project also requires significant time, with the group meeting at least twice a week and using Slack or Discord for communication. Coordinating schedules among five people can be difficult, but user finds the experience exciting despite the stress. They appreciate this opportunity to invest in academic projects focused on learning without the pressures of a job environment.User is overall enjoying their semester and has gained confidence in their problem-solving and time management skills. They used to dread tougher CS classes but now feel more capable, even if they still pull the occasional late night for debugging. Being a senior has given them a sense of confidence, and they believe that with effort and focus on their goals, they can figure things out. User's biggest takeaway from four years of study is learning to be resourceful, collaborate, and think critically. They find the tough classes rewarding and feel that their current work is building toward their future career."
