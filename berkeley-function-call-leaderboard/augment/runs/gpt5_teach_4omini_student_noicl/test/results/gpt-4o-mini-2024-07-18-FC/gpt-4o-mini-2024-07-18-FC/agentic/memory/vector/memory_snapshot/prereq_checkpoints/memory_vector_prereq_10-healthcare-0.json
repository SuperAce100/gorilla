            "1": "User has Type 2 Diabetes, diagnosed about ten years ago. They had to rethink their diet and lifestyle, cutting out sugary snacks, watching carb intake, and increasing physical activity.

            "6": "User has seasonal allergies that flare up every spring due to high pollen levels in Kansas. They had pneumonia a couple of years ago, which led to a long recovery. Since then, they have been diligent about getting their flu shot and pneumonia vaccine to prevent infections.",
