They are eyeing internships in Silicon Valley for next summer and might spend a couple of weeks exploring the West Coast if it works out. They have heard great things about Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, particularly regarding coffee, craft beer, and beautiful scenery. User is considering a road trip through Washington and Oregon after their internship, possibly with friends who will also be interning in the Bay Area.User has a family dog named Archie, a Golden Retriever who is super energetic. They would love to travel with him one day, but he doesn't like being cooped up in a car for too long, which led their family to leave him with their uncle during a road trip. User dreams of traveling in an RV or camper van with Archie, taking him on hikes and beach runs, envisioning it as a different type of adventure that would create amazing memories.User values travel as more than just ticking places off a bucket list; they appreciate the experiences gained from stepping outside their usual environment. Each locale has taught them something: Japan instilled a sense of reverence for tradition and efficiency, Maine reminded them of nature's timeless beauty, and Europe revealed the depth of art and culture spanning centuries. Even short trips near campus help them unwind and discover hidden gems. User enjoys collecting postcards during their travels, which remind them of the vast world beyond their bedroom. They find that experiencing new places heightens their curiosity and inspires creative problem-solving in their coding projects and research ideas.User plans to continue nurturing their passion for travel even after graduation. They hope to land a job in computer science that allows for remote work or flexible scheduling to keep exploring. User is open to weekend trips to nearby mountain ranges or flights to different continents. They would love to combine their coding skills with travel, such as working abroad or collaborating on international projects. For now, they enjoy planning their next journey in their head as a mental break from debugging code, which keeps them motivated and excited for the next phase of their life."
