The\\naverage billionaire is 66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a\\nselect few have gotten super-rich super young.\\n\\nThis year, the 25 youngest people on the _Forbes_ \\u2019 [World\\u2019s Billionaires\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\\") are all 33 or younger. Together they\\nare worth $110 billion. A few are self-made, having built notable companies\\nlike Snap (Evan Spiegel, 33), Gymshark (Ben Francis, 31) and Oculus VR (Palmer\\nLuckey, 31).\\n\\nMost had a lot of help. For the first time since 2009, every billionaire under\\n30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs\\naging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\n\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years\\nold and still in college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her\\nminority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late\\ngrandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are\\ntwo of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18\\nheirs among this set.\\n\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who\\nare worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based\\nconglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and\\nenergy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of\\ntheir father, Cyrus Mistry, who died less than three months after their\\nrevered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have [joined the\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/\\\") in the past three years due to a father\\u2019s passing.

Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress\\nto Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann,\\nwho died in January at age 84.\\n\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational\\nwealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the United\\nStates, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold\\n$95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal\\nReserve. Trillions are expected to change hands every year as the affluent\\nelderly pass away and leave their fortunes to descendants.

They aren\\u2019t being\\nreplaced. This year, there\\u2019s just one self-made newcomer among the 25\\nyoungest: Japan\\u2019s Shunsaku Sagami, 33, a merger and acquisitions dealmaker\\nwhose company M&A Research Institute Holdings uses AI to match clients.

The\\nbiggest year-over-year gain belongs to Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz, whose\\nfortune is up by $4.9 billion, followed by Michal Strnad, who inherited and\\nnow runs the defense producer Czechoslovak Group and is worth $2.4 billion\\nmore than last year.
