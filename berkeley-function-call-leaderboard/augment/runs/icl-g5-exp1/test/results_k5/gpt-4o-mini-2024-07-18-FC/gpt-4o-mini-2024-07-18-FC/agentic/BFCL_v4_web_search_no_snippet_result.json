It is available in a wide variety of flavors, such  as\\nlemonade\\n,\\nsweet tea\\n, and\\nfruit punch\\n.\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTest marketing and introduction\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCrystal Light was sold in test markets beginning in 1982.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nAs of mid-1983, it was being sold in 11 test areas.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nIt was introduced throughout the United States in April 1984.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nGeneral Foods sold $150 million of Crystal Light during the product's first year on national markets, representing 20% of all powdered drink mixes and 2/3 of all sugar-free drink mixes in the United States.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nAdvertisements\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1980s, ads for the product featured\\nLinda Evans\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n(who also featured in print ads for the product),\\nPriscilla Presley\\n,\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand\\nRaquel Welch\\n.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIngredients\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCrystal Light is sweetened with a combination of\\naspartame\\n,\\nacesulfame potassium\\n,\\nsucralose\\n, and/or sugar depending on the specific product line and flavor.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nFirst packaged in multi-serve canisters, Crystal Light launched single-serve \\\"On The Go\\\" packets in 2004. In 2009, Crystal Light redesigned its multi-serve packaging. On a finished case goods basis, the new design uses 250 tons less packaging than the original.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nIn 2010, Crystal Light launched Pure Fitness, a \\\"naturally-sweetened\\\" low-calorie fitness drink mix\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nwhich is sweetened with sugar and\\nTruvia\\n, a sweetener derived from the\\nstevia\\nplant. It is currently sold in \\\"On The Go\\\" packets.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn 2011, Crystal Light Pure Fitness was renamed Crystal Light Pure, and three additional flavors were introduced.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn April 2012, several Crystal Light varieties were added to the line of sodamix syrups for\\nSodaStream\\nhome soda makers.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nKraft Heinz, the parent company of Crystal Light, offers a product locator on its website to help locate flavors in a desired location. Crystal Light is sold in the U.S. and Canada.\\nCalories per serving have varied throughout the years; non-zero calorie flavors were once as low as 4 calories in 1990 and now, they may be as high as 15 in 2018, depending on flavor.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nHowever, it's not certain if the change is due to the use of new ingredients or if serving sizes have increased.\\nSome Crystal Light products, notably those designated as Crystal Light Energy, also contain an appreciable amount of added caffeine. The company has even experimented with displaying a prominent \\\"with caffeine\\\" tag below the product name on packaging. \\\"Crystal Light products with Energy positioning contain added caffeine,\\\" according to Kraft Heinz. \\\"Crystal Light Energy Wild Strawberry contains 60 mg caffeine per 8 fl oz serving\\\".  In fact, all Crystal Light Energy flavors contain this same amount of caffeine.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nCertain other Crystal Light flavors have long included caffeine as an ingredient. The label of Crystal Light Peach Iced Tea, for instance, says that the flavor contains \\\"25mg caffeine per serving,\\\" or about as much an eight-ounce (240 mL) cup of black tea.\\nProducts\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAll product information is based on information and products offered by Crystal Light's official website, as of January 2019.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nClassics\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBerry Sangria (0 cal)\\nBlack Cherry Lime (0 cal)\\nBlackberry Lemonade (0 cal)\\nBlueberry Raspberry (0 cal)\\nCaribbean Cooler (0 cal)\\nCherry Pomegranate (15 cal)\\nConcord Grape (15 cal)\\nFruit Punch (15 cal)\\nLemonade (15 cal)\\nMango Passionfruit (0 cal)\\nOrange (15 cal)\\nPink Lemonade (15 cal)\\nPomegranate Lemonade (0 cal)\\nRaspberry Ice (15 cal)\\nRaspberry Lemonade (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Kiwi (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Lemonade (0 cal)\\nStrawberry Orange Banana (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Watermelon (15 cal)\\nSweet Tea\\nTropical Coconut (0 cal)\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nPure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGrape (5 cal)\\nLemon (5 cal)\\nLemon Iced Tea (5 cal)\\nMixed Berry Energy (15 cal)\\nPeach Iced Tea (5 cal)\\nRaspberry Lemonade (5 cal)\\nStrawberry Kiwi (5 cal)\\nStrawberry Lemonade Energy (15 cal)\\nTangerine Mango (5 cal)\\nTropical Blend (5 cal)\\nTropical Citrus Energy (15 cal)\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\nLazarus, George (May 7, 1982).\\n\\\"GF, Wyler betting sugar free worth cost\\\"\\n.\\nChicago Tribune\\n. p.\\u00a088.\\n^\\nDean, Susan L.

Sep 2 2025\\n6:38 AM EDT\\nUpdated Tue, Sep 2 2025\\n10:49 AM EDT\\nAmelia Lucas\\n@Thxamelian\\nWATCH LIVE\\nKey Points\\nKraft Heinz will split into two companies.\\nThe deal will reverse much of the $46 billion merger envisioned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital.\\nShares of Kraft Heinz have slid roughly 60% since the merger closed in 2015.\\nIn this article\\nKHC\\nFollow your favorite stocks\\nCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\nIn this photo illustration, Kraft and Heinz products are shown on March 25, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.\\nGetty Images\\nKraft Heinz\\nwill split into two companies, reversing much of the blockbuster\\n$46 billion merger\\nfrom a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world.\\nThe first of the two new companies, which are not yet named, will primarily include shelf-stable meals and will be home to brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft mac and cheese. Kraft Heinz said that company on its own would have $15.4 billion in 2024 net sales, and approximately 75% of those sales would come from sauces, spreads and seasonings.\\nKraft Heinz said the second new company would be a \\\"scaled portfolio of North America staples\\\" and would include items such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables. That company would have had approximately\\u00a0$10.4 billion\\u00a0in 2024 net sales.\\n\\\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\\\" said\\u00a0Miguel Patricio, executive chair of the\\u00a0board for Kraft Heinz.\\u00a0\\\"By separating into two companies, we can allocate the right level of attention and resources to unlock the potential of each brand to drive better performance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.\\\"\\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.\\nThe deal that created\\nKraft Heinz in 2015\\nwas the brainchild of Warren Buffett's\\nBerkshire Hathaway\\nand private equity firm 3G Capital. While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster began to fade as the combined company's U.S. sales faltered.\\nThen came a\\ndisclosure in February 2019\\nthat Kraft Heinz had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls. The company also slashed its dividend by 36% and took a $15.4 billion write-down on Kraft and Oscar Mayer, two of its biggest brands. Days later,\\nBuffett\\ntold CNBC that\\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway had\\noverpaid\\nfor Kraft.\\nA leadership shake-up and more write-downs of iconic brands, like Maxwell House and Velveeta, followed. Kraft Heinz also began divesting some of its businesses, selling off\\nmost of its cheese unit\\nto French dairy giant Lactalis and its\\nnuts division\\n, including the Planters brand, to\\nHormel\\n.\\nIn recent quarters, the company has invested in boosting some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. Despite turnaround efforts, shares of Kraft Heinz have slid roughly 60% since the merger closed in 2015.\\nCurrent Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera will serve as chief executive of the new grocery staples-focused company after the separation. Kraft Heinz's board has hired an executive search firm to find a CEO for the other company.\\nThe split comes as more big food companies pursue breakups to divest from slower-growth categories and impress investors again.\\nIn August,\\nKeurig Dr Pepper\\nannounced that it will undo the 2018 deal that merged a coffee company with the 7UP owner. Keurig Dr Pepper\\nplans to separate\\nafter it closes its $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee company JDE Peet's. And two years ago, Kellogg\\nspun off\\nits snacks business into Kellanova and renamed itself as WK Kellogg.\\n\\u2014 CNBC's Michele Luhn contributed to this report.\\nDon\\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\\nTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardest\\nGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-end\\nChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.

From August 25\\u201327, 2017, players wore alternate team jerseys inspired by youth league designs. They also had the option to replace their last names with their nicknames on their jersey\\nnameplates\\n, and the vast majority of players did so.

Better AGI benchmarks clearly discern capabilities. The best AGI benchmarks do all this and actively inspire research and guide innovation.\\nAt ARC Prize, our mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks, directing efforts towards systems capable of general intelligence and significantly compressing the timeline for scientific breakthroughs.\\nARC-AGI-1 has measured progress towards AGI since 2019 and was the only benchmark to\\npinpoint the exact moment in late 2024\\nwhen AI moved beyond pure memorization. OpenAI used ARC-AGI-1 to demonstrate this progress with their o3-preview system which combines deep learning-based LLMs with reasoning synthesis engines.\\nARC Prize 2024 inspired thousands of independent\\nstudents\\nand\\nresearchers\\nto work alongside frontier labs on new test-time adaption ideas.\\nBut there is more work to do to reach AGI. AGI still needs new ideas.\\nWe can characterize systems like o3-preview as going from \\\"zero to one\\\" on the fluid intelligence spectrum. But these systems are highly inefficient and currently require significant human supervision during the training process to adapt to new domains.\\nAnnouncements\\nToday we\\u2019re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.\\nAlongside it, today we're launching\\nARC Prize 2025\\n, designed to drive open-source progress on highly efficient, general systems capable of beating ARC-AGI-2.\\nEasy for Humans, Hard for AI\\nAll other AI benchmarks focus on superhuman capabilities or specialized knowledge by testing \\\"PhD++\\\" skills. ARC-AGI is the only benchmark that takes the opposite design choice \\u2013 by focusing on tasks that are relatively easy for humans, yet hard, or impossible, for AI, we shine a spotlight on capability gaps that do not spontaneously emerge from \\\"scaling up\\\".\\nThe ARC Prize Foundation adapts this into our definition for measuring AGI: the gap between the set of tasks that are easy for humans and hard for AI. When this gap is zero, when there are no remaining tasks, we can find that challenge AI, we will have achieved AGI.\\nAddressing these capability gaps requires novel insight and new ideas. Importantly, ARC-AGI does not exist purely to measure AGI progress. It also exists to inspire researchers to work on new ideas.\\nIntelligence requires the ability to generalize from limited experience and apply knowledge in new, unexpected situations. AI systems are already superhuman in many specific domains (e.g., playing Go and image recognition.) However, these are narrow, specialized capabilities. The \\\"human-ai gap\\\" reveals what's missing for general intelligence - highly efficiently acquiring new skills.\\nIntroducing ARC-AGI-2\\nARC-AGI-2 Technical Paper\\nThe ARC-AGI-2 benchmark launches today. This second edition in the ARC-AGI series raises the bar for difficulty for AI while maintaining the same relative ease for humans.\\nEvery ARC-AGI-2 task was solved by at least 2 humans in 2 attempts or less in a controlled study with hundreds of human participants. This matches the rules we hold for AI, which gets two attempts per task.\\nARC-AGI-1, introduced in 2019, was designed to challenge deep learning. Specifically, it was designed to resist the ability to simply \\\"memorize\\\" the training dataset. ARC-AGI comprises a training dataset and several evaluation sets, including a private eval set used for the ARC Prize 2024 contest. The training set is intended to teach the Core Knowledge Priors required to solve tasks in the evaluation sets. To solve the evaluation tasks, AI systems must demonstrate basic fluid intelligence or the ability to adapt to novel, never-before-seen tasks.\\nAs an analogy, think of the training set as a way to learn grade school math symbols, and the evaluation set requires you to solve algebra equations using your knowledge of those symbols. You cannot simply memorize your way to the answer, you must apply existing knowledge to new problems.\\nAny AI system capable of beating ARC-AGI-1 demonstrates a binary level of fluid intelligence. In contrast, ARC-AGI-2 significantly raises the bar for AI. To beat it, you must demonstrate\\nboth\\na high level of adaptability and high efficiency.\\nWhile designing ARC-AGI-2, we studied these properties of frontier AI reasoning systems. Below are example tasks to illustrate some of what we discovered. All of the following tasks are part of ARC-AGI-2 and were (1) solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts and (2) unsolved by any frontier AI reasoning system.\\nNote: special thank you to the ARC Prize community for contributing to this analysis, including\\nMace\\n,\\nMikel\\n, and many members in the\\nARC Prize Discord\\n.\\nStill Hard for AI\\nSymbolic Interpretation\\nWe found that frontier AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring symbols to be interpreted as having meaning beyond their visual patterns. Systems attempted symmetry checking, mirroring, transformations, and even recognized connecting elements, but failed to assign semantic significance to the symbols themselves.\\nExample of symbolic interpretation, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #e3721c99.\\nTry this task.\\nCompositional Reasoning\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring simultaneous application of rules, or application of multiple rules that interact with each other. In contrast, if a task only has one, or very few, global rules, we found these systems can consistently discover and apply them.\\nExample of compositional reasoning, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #cbebaa4b.\\nTry this task.\\nContextual Rule Application\\nWe found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks where rules must be applied differently based on context. Systems tend to fixate on superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying selection principles.\\nExample of contextual rule application, ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #b5ca7ac4.\\nTry this task.\\nDatasets\\nARC-AGI-2 is comprised of the following datasets:\\nDataset\\nTask Quantity\\nCalibration\\nVisibilty\\nDescription\\nTraining\\n1000\\nUncalibrated\\nPublic\\nA spectrum of difficulty ranging from very easy to very difficult for both humans and AI, designed to expose and teach Core Knowledge Priors; use to train your system.\\nPublic Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPublic\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans; use to test your system.\\nSemi-Private Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for the Kaggle live contest leaderboard and ARC Prize leaderboard. \\\"Semi\\\" means these tasks may have been exposed to limited third-parties (e.g., via API.)\\nPrivate Eval\\n120\\nCalibrated\\nPrivate\\nAll tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for Kaggle final contest leaderboard. \\\"Private\\\" means these tasks have not been exposed to third-parties.\\nCalibrated\\nmeans that these tasks are IDD (independent and identically distributed). In principle, non-overfit scores across the public, semi-private, and private eval sets should be directly comparable. To gather these data, we tested with over 400 humans live in a controlled setting. Human solvability data for public tasks will be open-sourced alongside the ARC-AGI-2 paper in the coming weeks.\\nLike ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 uses a\\npass@2\\nmeasurement system to account for the fact that certain tasks have explicit ambiguity and require two guesses to disambiguate. As well as to catch any unintentional ambiguity or mistakes in the dataset. Given controlled human testing with ARC-AGI-2, we are more confident in the task quality compared to ARC-AGI-1.\\nHere's the official\\nchangelog\\nfor ARC-AGI-2:\\nAll eval sets (public, semi-private, private) now contain 120 tasks (up from 100).\\nRemoved tasks from eval sets that were susceptible to brute force search (all solved tasks from the original\\n2020 Kaggle contest\\n).\\nPerformed controlled human testing to calibrate eval set difficulty to ensure IDD and verify pass@2 solvability by at least 2 humans (to match AI rules).\\nDesigned new tasks to challenge AI reasoning systems based on study (symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, contextual rules, and more).\\nWe've also re-evaluated ARC-AGI-2 against all public AI systems. Here are the starting scores.\\nSystem\\nARC-AGI-1\\nARC-AGI-2\\nEfficiency (cost/task)\\nHuman panel (at least 2 humans)\\n98%\\n100%\\n$17\\nHuman panel (average)\\n64.2%\\n60%\\n$17\\no3-preview-low (CoT + Search/Synthesis)\\n75.7%\\n4%*\\n$200\\no1-pro (CoT + Search/Synthesis)\\n~50%\\n1%*\\n$200*\\nARChitects (Kaggle 2024 Winner)\\n53.5%\\n3%\\n$0.25\\no3-mini-high (Single CoT)\\n35%\\n0.0%\\n$0.41\\nr1 and r1-zero (Single CoT)\\n15.8%\\n0.3%\\n$0.08\\ngpt-4.5 (Pure LLM)\\n10.3%\\n0.0%\\n$0.29\\nScores labeled with * are in-progress estimates based on partial results we've been able to aggregate so far and o1-pro pricing. Full results will be published once available.\\nAll scores reported pass@2 and on the semi-private eval set (except ARC-AGI-1 human panel and ARChitects, which used public and private eval, respectively).\\nHuman panel efficiency is based upon a $115-150 show-up fee, plus a $5/task solve incentive. We optimized costs to produce show-ups (only 70% of registrations actually showed up). Even though we believe the true limit to human intelligence cost efficiency is likely in the $2-5/task range, we report $17/task to reflect the actual data we collected.\\nWe are looking forward to testing the production version of OpenAI o3-preview low/high once API access is available. Using ARC-AGI-1 tasks that transferred to ARC-AGI-2, we estimate that o3-preview-low would score ~4% and o3-high would potentially score up to 15-20% with very high compute (thousands of dollars per task).\\nIntelligence Is Not Just Capability\\nGoing forward, all ARC-AGI reporting will come along with an efficiency metric. We are starting with cost because it is the most directly comparable between human and AI performance.\\nIntelligence is not solely defined by the ability to solve problems or achieve high scores. The efficiency with which those capabilities are acquired and deployed is a crucial, defining component. The core question being asked is not just, \\\"Can AI acquire skill to solve a task?\\\" but also, \\\"At what efficiency or cost?\\\"\\nFrontier AI system scores on ARC-AGI-1 vs. ARC-AGI-2\\nWe know that brute-force search could eventually solve ARC-AGI (given unlimited resources and time to search). This would not represent true intelligence. Intelligence is about finding the solution efficiently, not exhaustively.\\nThis focus on efficiency is a core principle behind the ARC-AGI. We will now explicitly quantify the cost of intelligence, requiring solutions to demonstrate not just capability, but also the efficient use of resources that defines general intelligence.\\nOur\\nnew leaderboard page\\nreports progress along both a score and cost axis.\\nARC-AGI's new leaderboard showing both score and efficiency as of March 24, 2025\\nCompetition Now Open! $1,000,000 in Prizes\\nAlongside ARC-AGI-2, we're excited to announce\\nARC Prize 2025 is now live\\n!

The\\naverage billionaire is 66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a\\nselect few have gotten super-rich super young.\\n\\nThis year, the 25 youngest people on the _Forbes_ \\u2019 [World\\u2019s Billionaires\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\\") are all 33 or younger. Together they\\nare worth $110 billion. A few are self-made, having built notable companies\\nlike Snap (Evan Spiegel, 33), Gymshark (Ben Francis, 31) and Oculus VR (Palmer\\nLuckey, 31).\\n\\nMost had a lot of help. For the first time since 2009, every billionaire under\\n30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs\\naging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\n\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years\\nold and still in college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her\\nminority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late\\ngrandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are\\ntwo of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18\\nheirs among this set.\\n\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who\\nare worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based\\nconglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and\\nenergy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of\\ntheir father, Cyrus Mistry, who died less than three months after their\\nrevered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have [joined the\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/\\\") in the past three years due to a father\\u2019s passing. Italy\\u2019s\\nClemente Del Vecchio, 19, received a hefty stake in the Italian-French maker\\nof Ray-Ban, EssilorLuxottica, after the 2022 death of Leonardo Del Vecchio.\\nHis brothers Leonardo Maria, 28, and Luca, 22, also inherited fortunes, as did\\nthree older siblings. Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress\\nto Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann,\\nwho died in January at age 84.\\n\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational\\nwealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the United\\nStates, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold\\n$95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal\\nReserve. Trillions are expected to change hands every year as the affluent\\nelderly pass away and leave their fortunes to descendants.

They aren\\u2019t being\\nreplaced. This year, there\\u2019s just one self-made newcomer among the 25\\nyoungest: Japan\\u2019s Shunsaku Sagami, 33, a merger and acquisitions dealmaker\\nwhose company M&A Research Institute Holdings uses AI to match clients.

It is located on the\\nRight Bank\\nof the\\nSeine\\nin the city's\\n1st arrondissement\\n(district) and home to some of the most\\ncanonical\\nworks of\\nWestern art\\n, including the\\nMona Lisa\\n,\\nVenus de Milo\\n, and\\nWinged Victory\\n. The museum is housed in the\\nLouvre Palace\\n, originally built in the late 12th to 13th\\u00a0century under\\nPhilip II\\n. Remnants of the\\nMedieval Louvre\\nfortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546\\nFrancis I\\nconverted it into the primary residence of the\\nFrench kings\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nThe building was redesigned and extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682,\\nLouis XIV\\nchose the\\nPalace of Versailles\\nfor his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nIn 1692, the building was occupied by the\\nAcad\\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\\nand the\\nAcad\\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture\\n, which in 1699 held the first of a series of\\nsalons\\n. The Acad\\u00e9mie remained at the Louvre for 100 years.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nDuring the\\nFrench Revolution\\n, the\\nNational Assembly\\ndecreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.  The palace and exhibition space was expanded in the 19th century and again in the 20th.\\nThe museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537\\u00a0paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed from 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under\\nNapoleon\\n, after the\\nNapoleonic looting of art\\nin Europe, Egypt, and Syria, and the museum was renamed\\nMus\\u00e9e Napol\\u00e9on\\n, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nThe collection was further increased during the reigns of\\nLouis XVIII\\nand\\nCharles X\\n, and during the\\nSecond French Empire\\nthe museum gained 20,000\\u00a0pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the\\nThird Republic\\n. The collection is divided into eight departments:\\nEgyptian Antiquities\\n;\\nNear Eastern Antiquities\\n;\\nGreek\\n,\\nEtruscan\\n, and\\nRoman Antiquities\\n;\\nIslamic Art\\n; Sculpture;\\nDecorative Arts\\n; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.\\nThe Mus\\u00e9e du Louvre contains approximately 500,000\\u00a0objects\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand displays 35,000\\u00a0works of art in eight curatorial departments with more than 60,600\\u00a0m\\n2\\n(652,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) dedicated to the permanent collection.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe Louvre exhibits sculptures,\\nobjets d'art\\n, paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. At any given point in time, approximately 38,000\\u00a0objects from prehistory to the 21st century are being exhibited over an area of 72,735\\u00a0m\\n2\\n(782,910\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft), making it the\\nlargest museum in the world\\n. It received 8.7 million visitors in 2024,  ranking it as the most-visited art museum, and most-visited museum of any category, in the world.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nLocation and visiting\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAerial view of the\\nTuileries Gardens\\non the left, with the Louvre Palace on the right (2018)\\nThe Louvre museum is located inside the Louvre Palace, in the centre of Paris, adjacent to the\\nTuileries Gardens\\n. The two nearest\\nM\\u00e9tro\\nstations are\\nLouvre\\u2013Rivoli\\nand\\nPalais Royal\\u2013Mus\\u00e9e du Louvre\\n, the latter having a direct underground access to the\\nCarrousel du Louvre\\ncommercial mall.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nBefore the\\nGrand Louvre\\noverhaul of the late 1980s and 1990s, the Louvre had several street-level entrances, most of which are now permanently closed. Since 1993, the museum's main entrance has been the underground space under the\\nLouvre Pyramid\\n, or\\nHall Napol\\u00e9on\\n, which can be accessed from the Pyramid itself, from the underground Carrousel du Louvre, or (for authorised visitors) from the\\npassage Richelieu\\nconnecting to the nearby\\nrue de Rivoli\\n. A secondary entrance at the\\nPorte des Lions\\n, near the western end of the Denon Wing, was created in 1999 but is not permanently open.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nThe museum's entrance conditions have varied over time. Prior to the 1850s, artists and foreign visitors had privileged access. At the time of initial opening in 1793, the\\nFrench Republican calendar\\nhad imposed ten-day \\\"weeks\\\" (French:\\nd\\u00e9cades\\n), the first six days of which were reserved for visits by artists and foreigners and the last three for visits by the general public.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n:\\u200a37\\nIn the early 1800s, after the seven-day week had been reinstated, the general public had only four hours of museum access per week, between 2pm and 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n:\\u200a8\\nIn 1824, a new regulation allowed public access only on Sundays and holidays; the other days the museum was open only to artists and foreigners, except for closure on Mondays.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n:\\u200a39\\nThat changed in 1855 when the museum became open to the public all days except Mondays.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n:\\u200a40\\nIt was free until 1922, when an entrance fee was introduced except on Sundays.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n:\\u200a42\\nSince its post-\\nWorld War II\\nreopening in 1946,\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n:\\u200a43\\nthe Louvre has been closed on Tuesdays, and habitually open to the public the rest of the week except for some holidays.\\nThe use of cameras and video recorders is permitted inside, but flash photography is forbidden.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nBeginning in 2012,\\nNintendo 3DS\\nportable video game systems were used as the official museum audio guides.

In the 14th\\u00a0century,\\nCharles V\\nconverted the building from its military role into a residence. In 1546,\\nFrancis I\\nstarted its rebuilding in\\nFrench Renaissance\\nstyle.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nAfter Louis XIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, construction works slowed to a halt. The royal move away from Paris resulted in the Louvre being used as a residence for artists, under Royal patronage.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a42\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nFor example, four generations of craftsmen-artists from the Boulle family were granted Royal patronage and resided in the Louvre.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n[\\n30\\n]\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nMeanwhile, the collections of the Louvre originated in the acquisitions of paintings and other artworks by the monarchs of the\\nHouse of France\\n. At the\\nPalace of Fontainebleau\\n, Francis collected art that would later be part of the Louvre's art collections, including\\nLeonardo da Vinci\\n's\\nMona Lisa\\n.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nThe Cabinet du Roi consisted of seven rooms west of the Galerie d'Apollon on the upper floor of the remodelled Petite Galerie. Many of the king's paintings were placed in these rooms in 1673, when it became an art gallery, accessible to certain art lovers as a kind of museum. In 1681, after the court moved to Versailles, 26 of the paintings were transferred there, somewhat diminishing the collection, but it is mentioned in Paris guide books from 1684 on, and was shown to ambassadors from\\nSiam\\nin 1686.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nBy the mid-18th\\u00a0century there were proposals to create a public gallery in the Louvre.

On 14 October 1750,\\nLouis XV\\ndecided on a display of 96 pieces from the royal collection, mounted in the Galerie royale de peinture of the\\nLuxembourg Palace\\n. A hall was opened by\\nLe Normant de Tournehem\\nand the\\nMarquis de Marigny\\nfor public viewing of the \\\"king's paintings\\\" (\\nTableaux du Roy\\n) on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The Luxembourg gallery included\\nAndrea del Sarto\\n's\\nCharity\\nand works by\\nRaphael\\n;\\nTitian\\n;\\nVeronese\\n;\\nRembrandt\\n;\\nPoussin\\nor\\nVan Dyck\\n. It closed in 1780 as a result of the royal gift of the Luxembourg palace to the Count of Provence (the future king,\\nLouis XVIII\\n) by the king in 1778.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nUnder\\nLouis XVI\\n, the idea of a royal museum in the Louvre came closer to fruition.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nThe\\ncomte d'Angiviller\\nbroadened the collection and in 1776 proposed to convert the\\nGrande Galerie\\nof the Louvre \\u2013 which at that time contained the\\nplans-reliefs\\nor 3D models of key fortified sites in and around France \\u2013 into the \\\"French Museum\\\".

This treaty marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy and the end of the first phase of the\\nFrench Revolutionary Wars\\n. It compelled Italian cities to contribute pieces of art and heritage to Napoleon's \\\"parades of spoils\\\" through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nThe\\nHorses of Saint Mark\\n, which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of\\nConstantinople\\nin 1204, were brought to Paris where they were placed atop Napoleon's\\nArc de Triomphe du Carrousel\\nin 1797.\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nUnder the Treaty of Tolentino, the two statues of the Nile and Tiber were taken to Paris from the Vatican in 1797, and were both kept in the Louvre until 1815. (The Nile was later returned to Rome,\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nwhereas the Tiber has remained in the Louvre to this day.) The despoilment of Italian churches and palaces outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nAfter the French defeat at\\nWaterloo\\n, the looted works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrator, Denon, was loath to comply in absence of a treaty of restitution. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and many pieces were returned, though far from all.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a69\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nIn 1815\\nLouis XVIII\\nfinally concluded agreements with the\\nAustrian\\ngovernment\\n[\\n48\\n]\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nfor the keeping of works such as Veronese's\\nWedding at Cana\\nwhich was exchanged for a large\\nLe Brun\\nor the repurchase of the\\nAlbani\\ncollection.\\nFrom 1815 to 1852\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe\\nVenus de Milo\\nwas added to the Louvre's collection during the reign of\\nLouis XVIII\\n.\\nFor most of the 19th century, from\\nNapoleon\\n's time to the\\nSecond Empire\\n, the Louvre and other national museums were managed under the monarch's\\ncivil list\\nand thus depended much on the ruler's personal involvement. Whereas the most iconic collection remained that of paintings in the\\nGrande Galerie\\n, a number of other initiatives mushroomed in the vast building, named as if they were separate museums even though they were generally managed under the same administrative umbrella. Correspondingly, the museum complex was often referred to in the plural (\\\"\\nles mus\\u00e9es du Louvre\\n\\\") rather than singular.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nDuring the\\nBourbon Restoration\\n(1814\\u20131830),\\nLouis XVIII\\nand\\nCharles X\\nadded to the collections. The Greek and Roman sculpture gallery on the ground floor of the southwestern side of the\\nCour Carr\\u00e9e\\nwas completed on designs by\\nPercier and Fontaine\\n. In 1819 an exhibition of manufactured products was opened in the first floor of the Cour Carr\\u00e9e's southern wing and would stay there until the mid-1820s.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\n:\\u200a87\\nCharles X in 1826 created the\\nMus\\u00e9e \\u00c9gyptien\\nand in 1827 included it in his broader\\nMus\\u00e9e Charles X\\n, a new section of the museum complex located in a suite of lavishly decorated rooms on the first floor of the South Wing of the Cour Carr\\u00e9e. The Egyptian collection, initially curated by\\nJean-Fran\\u00e7ois Champollion\\n, formed the basis for what is now the Louvre's\\nDepartment of Egyptian Antiquities\\n. It was formed from the purchased collections of\\nEdm\\u00e9-Antoine Durand\\n,\\nHenry Salt\\nand the second collection of\\nBernardino Drovetti\\n(the first one having been purchased by\\nVictor Emmanuel I of Sardinia\\nto form the core of the present\\nMuseo Egizio\\nin\\nTurin\\n). The Restoration period also saw the opening in 1824 of the\\nGalerie d'Angoul\\u00eame\\n, a section of largely French sculptures on the ground floor of the Northwestern side of the Cour Carr\\u00e9e, many of whose artefacts came from the\\nPalace of Versailles\\nand from Alexandre Lenoir's\\nMus\\u00e9e des Monuments Fran\\u00e7ais\\nfollowing its closure in 1816.

As a consequence, the works were removed after Louis-Philippe was deposed in 1848, and were eventually auctioned away in 1853.\\nThe short-lived\\nSecond Republic\\nhad more ambitions for the Louvre. It initiated repair work, the completion of the\\nGalerie d'Apollon\\nand of the\\nsalle des sept-chemin\\u00e9es\\n, and the overhaul of the\\nSalon Carr\\u00e9\\n(former site of the iconic yearly\\nSalon\\n) and of the Grande Galerie.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a52\\nIn 1848, the Naval Museum in the Cour Carr\\u00e9e's attic was brought under the common Louvre Museum management,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\na change which was again reversed in 1920.

In 1852, he created the\\nMus\\u00e9e des Souverains\\nin the\\nColonnade Wing\\n, an ideological project aimed at buttressing his personal legitimacy. In 1861, he bought 11,835\\u00a0artworks including 641 paintings, Greek gold and other antiquities of the\\nCampana collection\\n. For its display, he created another new section within the Louvre named\\nMus\\u00e9e Napol\\u00e9on III\\n, occupying a number of rooms in various parts of the building. Between 1852 and 1870, the museum added 20,000\\u00a0new artefacts to its collections.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nThe main change of that period was to the building itself. In the 1850s architects\\nLouis Visconti\\nand\\nHector Lefuel\\ncreated massive new spaces around what is now called the\\nCour Napol\\u00e9on\\n, some of which (in the South Wing, now Aile Denon) went to the museum.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a52-54\\nIn the 1860s, Lefuel also led the creation of the\\npavillon des Sessions\\nwith a new\\nSalle des Etats\\ncloser to Napoleon III's residence in the\\nTuileries Palace\\n, with the effect of shortening the\\nGrande Galerie\\nby about a third of its previous length.

On 23 May 1871, as the French Army advanced into Paris, a force of\\nCommunards\\nled by\\nJules Bergeret\\n[\\nfr\\n]\\nset fire to the adjoining\\nTuileries Palace\\n. The fire burned for forty-eight hours, entirely destroying the interior of the Tuileries and spreading to the north west wing of the museum next to it. The emperor's Louvre library (\\nBiblioth\\u00e8que du Louvre\\n) and some of the adjoining halls, in what is now the Richelieu Wing, were separately destroyed. But the museum was saved by the efforts of Paris firemen and museum employees led by curator\\nHenry Barbet de Jouy\\n.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nFollowing the end of the monarchy, several spaces in the Louvre's South Wing went to the museum. The Salle du Man\\u00e8ge was transferred to the museum in 1879, and in 1928 became its main entrance lobby.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nThe large Salle des Etats that had been created by Lefuel between the\\nGrande Galerie\\nand Pavillon Denon was redecorated in 1886 by\\nEdmond Guillaume\\n[\\nfr\\n]\\n, Lefuel's successor as architect of the Louvre, and opened as a spacious exhibition room.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nEdomond Guillaume also decorated the first-floor room at the northwest corner of the\\nCour Carr\\u00e9e\\n, on the ceiling of which he placed in 1890 a monumental painting by\\nCarolus-Duran\\n,\\nThe Triumph of\\nMarie de' Medici\\noriginally created in 1879 for the\\nLuxembourg Palace\\n.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nThe Louvre's monumental\\nEscalier Daru\\n, topped by the\\nWinged Victory of Samothrace\\n, took its current appearance in the early 1930s.\\nMeanwhile, during the\\nThird Republic\\n(1870\\u20131940) the Louvre acquired new artefacts mainly via donations, gifts, and sharing arrangements on excavations abroad. The 583-item\\nCollection La Caze\\n, donated in 1869 by\\nLouis La Caze\\n, included works by\\nChardin\\n;\\nFragonard\\n,\\nRembrandt\\nand\\nWatteau\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a70-71\\nIn 1883, the\\nWinged Victory of Samothrace\\n, which had been found in the Aegean Sea in 1863, was prominently displayed as the focal point of the\\nEscalier Daru\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n:\\u200a70-71\\nMajor artefacts excavated at\\nSusa\\nin Iran, including the massive\\nApadana capital\\nand glazed brick decoration from the\\nPalace of Darius\\nthere, accrued to the Oriental (Near Eastern) Antiquities Department in the 1880s.

The expansion of the museum and its collections slowed after World War I, however, despite some prominent acquisitions such as\\nGeorges de La Tour\\n's\\nSaint Thomas\\nand\\nBaron Edmond de Rothschild\\n's 1935 donation of 4,000\\u00a0prints, 3,000\\u00a0drawings, and 500\\u00a0illustrated books.\\nFrom the late 19th century, the Louvre gradually veered away from its mid-century ambition of universality to become a more focused museum of French, Western and Near Eastern art, covering a space ranging from\\nIran\\nto the Atlantic. The collections of the Louvre's\\nmus\\u00e9e mexicain\\nwere transferred to the\\nMus\\u00e9e d'Ethnographie du Trocad\\u00e9ro\\nin 1887. As the\\nMus\\u00e9e de Marine\\nwas increasingly constrained to display its core naval-themed collections in the limited space it had in the second-floor\\nattic\\nof the northern half of the Cour Carr\\u00e9e, many of its significant holdings of non-Western artefacts were transferred in 1905 to the Trocad\\u00e9ro ethnography museum, the\\nNational Antiquities Museum\\nin\\nSaint-Germain-en-Laye\\n, and the\\nChinese Museum\\nin the\\nPalace of Fontainebleau\\n.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nThe Mus\\u00e9e de Marine itself was relocated to the\\nPalais de Chaillot\\nin 1943.

The\\nCour du Sphinx\\nin the South Wing was covered by a glass roof in 1934. Decorative arts exhibits were expanded in the first floor of the North Wing of the\\nCour Carr\\u00e9e\\n, including some of France's first\\nperiod room\\ndisplays. In the late 1930s, The La Caze donation was moved to a remodelled\\nSalle La Caze\\nabove the\\nsalle des Caryatides\\n, with reduced height to create more rooms on the second floor and a sober interior design by Albert Ferran.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, the Louvre conducted an elaborate plan of\\nevacuation of its art collection\\n.

The French art loans, expected to total between 200 and 300\\u00a0artworks during a 10-year period, come from multiple museums, including the Louvre, the\\nCentre Georges Pompidou\\n, the\\nMus\\u00e9e d'Orsay\\n,\\nVersailles\\n, the\\nGuimet Museum\\n, the\\nMus\\u00e9e Rodin\\n, and the\\nMus\\u00e9e du quai Branly\\n.\\n[\\n176\\n]\\nControversies\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe Louvre is involved in controversies that surround cultural property\\nseized\\nunder Napoleon I,\\n[\\n177\\n]\\n[\\npage\\u00a0needed\\n]\\nas well as during World War II\\nby the Nazis\\n.\\n[\\n178\\n]\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nIn the early 2010s, workers' rights in the construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi were also a point of controversy for the museum.\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nNapoleonic looting\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nNapoleon's campaigns acquired Italian pieces by treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils, as well as some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the\\nBritish Museum\\n. On the other hand, the\\nDendera zodiac\\nis, like the\\nRosetta Stone\\n, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favour of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via\\nUNESCO\\n's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin.\\n[\\n181\\n]\\nThe museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30\\u00a0cm x 15\\u00a0cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of\\nd\\u00e9classement\\nfrom French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des mus\\u00e9es de France.\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nNazi looting\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDuring\\nNazi occupation\\n, thousands of artworks were stolen.\\n[\\n183\\n]\\nBut after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and were assigned to the Office des Biens Priv\\u00e9s.\\n[\\n184\\n]\\nIn 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Mus\\u00e9es de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Mus\\u00e9es Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations\\n[\\n185\\n]\\nand until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined at the end of the 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nThey were exhibited in 1946 and shown all together to the public during four years (1950\\u20131954) in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties, then stored or displayed, according to their interest, in several French museums including the Louvre. From 1951 to 1965, about 37 pieces were restituted. Since November 1996, the partly illustrated catalogue of 1947\\u20131949 has been accessible online and completed. In 1997, Prime Minister\\nAlain Jupp\\u00e9\\ninitiated the Matt\\u00e9oli Commission, headed by\\nJean Matt\\u00e9oli\\n, to investigate the matter and according to the government, the Louvre is in charge of 678\\u00a0pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nDuring the late 1990s, the comparison of the American war archives, which had not been done before, with the French and German ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs' rights (\\nGentili di Giuseppe\\nand Rosenberg families) allowed more accurate investigations. Since 1996, the restitutions, according sometimes to less formal criteria, concerned 47 more pieces (26 paintings, with 6 from the Louvre including a then displayed Tiepolo), until the last claims of French owners and their heirs ended again in 2006.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nAccording to\\nSerge Klarsfeld\\n, since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in 1996, the majority of the French Jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal French civil rule of\\nprescription acquisitive\\nof any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common French heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during World War II.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nConstruction of Louvre Abu Dhabi\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn 2011, over 130 international artists urged a boycott of the new Guggenheim museum as well as Louvre Abu Dhabi, citing reports, since 2009, of abuses of foreign construction workers on Saadiyat Island, including the arbitrary withholding of wages, unsafe working conditions, and failure of companies to pay or reimburse the steep recruitment fees being charged to labourers.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nAccording to\\nArchitectural Record\\n, Abu Dhabi has comprehensive labour laws to protect the workers, but they are not conscientiously implemented or enforced.\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 2010, the Guggenheim Foundation placed on its website a joint statement with Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) recognising the following workers' rights issues, among others: health and safety of the workers; their access to their passports and other documents that the employers have been retaining to guaranty that they stay on the job; using a general contractor that agrees to obey the labour laws; maintaining an independent site monitor; and ending the system that has been generally used in the Persian Gulf region of requiring workers to reimburse recruitment fees.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nIn 2013,\\nThe Observer\\nreported that conditions for the workers at the Louvre and New York University construction sites on Saadiyat amounted to \\\"modern-day slavery\\\".\\n[\\n192\\n]\\n[\\n193\\n]\\nIn 2014, the Guggenheim's Director,\\nRichard Armstrong\\n, said that he believed that living conditions for the workers at the Louvre project were now good and that \\\"many fewer\\\" of them were having their passports confiscated. He stated that the main issue then remaining was the recruitment fees charged to workers by agents who recruit them.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nLater in 2014, the Guggenheim's architect, Gehry, commented that working with the Abu Dhabi officials to implement the law to improve the labour conditions at the museum's site is \\\"a moral responsibility.\\\"\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nHe encouraged the TDIC to build additional worker housing and proposed that the contractor cover the cost of the recruitment fees. In 2012, TDIC engaged\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\\nas an independent monitor required to issue reports every quarter. Labour lawyer Scott Horton told\\nArchitectural Record\\nthat he hoped the Guggenheim project will influence the treatment of workers on other Saadiyat sites and will \\\"serve as a model for doing things right.\\\"\\n[\\n190\\n]\\n[\\n196\\n]\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nArts portal\\nVisual arts portal\\nHistory portal\\nFrance portal\\nH\\u00f4tel du Louvre\\nList of museums in Paris\\nMus\\u00e9e de la mode et du textile\\nList of tourist attractions in Paris\\nList of largest art museums\\nNotes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\nEnglish:\\n/\\n\\u02c8\\nl\\nu\\u02d0\\nv\\n.\\nr\\n\\u0259\\n/\\nLOOV\\n-r\\u0259\\n,\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nalso\\nUS\\n:\\n/\\n\\u02c8\\nl\\nu\\u02d0\\nv\\n/\\n\\u24d8\\nLOOV\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nRapport d'activit\\u00e9 2019 du mus\\u00e9e du Louvre\\n, p. 29, website www.louvre.fr.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\n\\\"Louvre Museum\\\"\\n.\\nmuseums.eu\\n.\\n^\\n[ Louvre press release, 8 January 2025\\n^\\n\\\"LOUVRE Definition & Meaning\\\"\\n.\\nCollins English Dictionary\\n.\\nHarperCollins Publishers\\n. 2012.\\nArchived\\nfrom the original on 2 December 2024\\n.

For the top tier of Hollywood\\ntalent, acting in a film has become just one element of a multi-year, multi-\\nplatform partnership between a studio and an actor to develop, produce, and\\nmost importantly market a project to audiences.\\n\\nThose who have proven their ability to personally convert fans into customers\\nhave become more valuable than ever before. Johnson\\u2019s contract for _Red One_ ,\\nwhich included up-front fees for acting and producing\\u2014as well as a buyout of\\nback-end participation for both roles\\u2014will pay him an estimated $50 million,\\nbelieved to be the highest fee-plus-buyout total in history for a single\\nmovie.\\n\\nWhen combined with Johnson\\u2019s impressive deal for _Moana 2_ and his catalog of\\nolder titles, he earned an estimated $88 million last year (after paying fees\\nto his agent and lawyer), making him the highest-paid actor of 2024.\\n\\nRight on his heels is Ryan Reynolds, who, similarly, was the lead producer,\\nco-writer and star of the year\\u2019s biggest live-action theatrical hit, _Deadpool\\n& Wolverine_. He even produced commercials for the movie through his marketing\\nagency, Maximum Effort. Reynolds\\u2019 busy year was rewarded with an estimated $85\\nmillion (after fees), though in the end 2024 might be remembered for the\\n[swarm of lawsuits between his wife, Blake Lively, and _It Ends With Us_\\nfilmmaker Justin\\nBaldoni](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/02/21/justin-baldoni-\\nvs-blake-lively-feud-explained-lively-reynolds-say-theyve-received-violent-\\nmessages/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/02/21/justin-\\nbaldoni-vs-blake-lively-feud-explained-lively-reynolds-say-theyve-received-\\nviolent-messages/\\\"), which have seen his name littered throughout court\\ndocuments.\\n\\nClose behind Johnson and Reynolds, in third place, is another power\\npromoter\\u2014Kevin Hart, whose unrivaled volume of self-produced movies, TV shows,\\npodcasts and stand-up comedy continues to reinforce his status as the hardest-\\nworking man in show business, and brought in an estimated $81 million.\\n\\nThose three multi-hyphenates earned the same amount as the rest of the top 10\\ncombined, lapping veteran movie stars like Brad Pitt ($32 million), Nicole\\nKidman ($31 million) and [2023\\u2019s highest-paid actor, Adam\\nSandler](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\\") ($26 million)\\u2014none of whom come with\\ntheir own built-in marketing machine.\\n\\nStill, it pays to be an established hitmaker from a previous generation. The\\naverage age of the top 20, who combined for more than $730 million in earnings\\nlast year, is a little over 54 years old. These actors benefit not only from\\nhigh salaries set by the precedent of past hits, they continue to receive\\nsizable checks each year from those old projects, whether it be TV shows\\u2014\\n_Forbes_ estimates Jerry Seinfeld (No. 4 this year) pockets $30 million each\\nyear for creating _Seinfeld\\u2014_ or decades\\u2019 worth of movies. For example, Matt\\nDamon (No. 16) earned an estimated $8 million last year in profit\\nparticipations from his back catalog, which includes the _Bourne_ and\\n_Ocean\\u2019s_ franchises.\\n\\nThat has made it difficult for new stars to enter the top echelon of pay in\\nHollywood. [Last year\\u2019s top\\n20](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\\") doesn\\u2019t include any actors in their\\n20s or 30s (the youngest is Scarlett Johansson, 40, at No. 19), even after a\\nbreakout year for young stars like Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell and Zendaya.\\nTheir fees have jumped for future projects, say representatives around\\nHollywood, and they are among the hardest actors to book right now, but the\\nconsensus is that they will need to continue to prove that the success came as\\na direct result of their billing in order to achieve top earnings in future\\nyears.\\n\\nEven Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, 29, considered by the industry to be best positioned\\nfor mega-stardom, fell well short of this year\\u2019s list because his Oscar-\\nnominated role as Bob Dylan in _A Complete Unknown_ was negotiated years ago,\\nbefore _Wonka_ and _Dune 2_ turned him into a household name.\\n\\nUnlike last year\\u2019s one-two punch of _Barbie_ and _Oppenheimer_ , most of this\\nyear\\u2019s fortunes were made away from the box office. Six of the top 10 highest-\\ngrossing movies of 2024 were animated, an area of the business where actors\\ngenerally don\\u2019t receive high salaries.\\n\\nWith theatrical releases appearing increasingly risky, A-list talent instead\\nflocked to streaming services, where so-called buyout deals are still the\\nnorm, paying talent a premium flat fee. In a competitive situation in which\\nApple, Amazon and Netflix are all vying for the same star-driven package, an\\nactor might receive a total compensation well over the still-standard $20\\nmillion up-front fee for theatrical movies, as was the case with Pitt (No. 6)\\nand George Clooney (No. 7) for _Wolfs_.\\n\\nWhether that trend continues, or whether the industry\\u2019s chants of \\u201csurvive to\\n\\u201825\\u201d are rewarded with a box office renaissance this year, there remains an\\nironclad belief among agents, managers, lawyers and studio executives that\\nmovie stars are always going to be essential to the future of Hollywood.\\n\\nUltimately, even more than the money earned, the annual list of the highest-\\npaid actors represents a measure of the control that talent can wield within\\nthe industry, and how they choose to use it.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/WireImage/Getty Images\\n\\n## **#1.** **Dwayne Johnson**\\n\\n### $88 million ($103 million gross)\\n\\nThe Rock returned to the top of the [highest-paid\\nactors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/08/11/the-highest-paid-\\nactors-of-2020-dwayne-johnson-ryan-reynolds/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/08/11/the-highest-paid-actors-\\nof-2020-dwayne-johnson-ryan-reynolds/\\\") list after landing what is believed to\\nbe the largest fee-plus-buyout in streaming movie history, an estimated $50\\nmillion to star in Amazon's _Red One_ last year.

He holed out for birdie on the 18th to finish at three under and four shots back of Scheffler.\\nLudvig \\u00c5berg\\n, making his Masters and major championship debut, was four under on his round until a bogey at the 14th. He then left his third shot on the 15th short and three-putted from just off the green for another bogey. He shot 70 (\\u20132) and ended up at four under.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNicolai H\\u00f8jgaard\\nmoved into sole possession of the lead following a run of three straight birdies from holes 8 to 10, but he then made five straight bogeys including hitting into the water on both the 13th and 15th and finished at two under.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nTiger Woods\\ncarded a 10-over-par 82 for the third round, his highest score ever in a major championship.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nNo eagles were recorded on the par-5 15th hole through the first three rounds, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that No. 15 has failed to produce an eagle by this point in the tournament.\\nShane Lowry\\nscored an eagle on the par-4 14th hole, marking the first eagle on this hole since\\nMartin Kaymer\\nin\\n2016\\n.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nPlace\\nPlayer\\nScore\\nTo par\\n1\\nScottie Scheffler\\n66-72-71=209\\n\\u22127\\n2\\nCollin Morikawa\\n71-70-69=210\\n\\u22126\\n3\\nMax Homa\\n67-71-73=211\\n\\u22125\\n4\\nLudvig \\u00c5berg\\n73-69-70=212\\n\\u22124\\n5\\nBryson DeChambeau\\n65-73-75=213\\n\\u22123\\nT6\\nCameron Davis\\n69-72-73=214\\n\\u22122\\nNicolai H\\u00f8jgaard\\n67-73-74=214\\nXander Schauffele\\n72-72-70=214\\nT9\\nAn Byeong-hun\\n70-73-72=215\\n\\u22121\\nTommy Fleetwood\\n72-71-72=215\\nCameron Smith\\n71-72-72=215\\nCameron Young\\n70-73-72=215\\nFinal round\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nSunday, April 14, 2024\\nScottie Scheffler\\nwon his second Masters title\\nExternal videos\\nFull final round coverage on CBS\\non\\nYouTube\\nWorld No. 1\\nScottie Scheffler\\nshot a four-under 68 to win his second Masters title in the last three years by four shots over runner-up\\nLudvig \\u00c5berg\\n.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nScheffler began the round with a one-shot lead and birdied the third hole to go two shots ahead. He then bogeyed the fourth after hitting his tee shot over the green.\\nMax Homa\\nbirdied the second, his first birdie in 34 holes, to get within one of the lead, while \\u00c5berg hit his approach on the seventh to four feet and made birdie to also get within one of the lead.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nScheffler bogeyed the seventh to create a three-way tie with \\u00c5berg and\\nCollin Morikawa\\nat six under, while Homa joined the lead with a two-putt birdie at the par-five eighth. Both Scheffler and Morikawa birdied the eighth to get to seven under, while \\u00c5berg holed a 36-foot birdie putt on the ninth to again tie. Scheffler then hit his approach on the ninth to within a foot for another birdie to get to 8 under and again in sole possession of the lead going to the second nine.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nAll three challengers then fell from contention. Morikawa hit his second shot on the ninth into a greenside bunker and couldn't advance on his third, ending up with a double bogey to fall three shots behind. He found the water on his approach at the 11th and made another double bogey. \\u00c5berg also hit into the water on the 11th for a double bogey. Homa got back within one with a close approach to the 10th, but his tee shot on the 12th flew over the green into the bushes and he was forced to take a drop. He made a double bogey on the hole to fall three shots behind.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nScheffler birdied the 10th, his third birdie in a row, to get to nine under and open a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey on the 11th, Scheffler two-putted for birdie at the par-five 13th and hit his second shot on the 14th to within four feet for another birdie to reach 10 under. He then made a nine-foot birdie putt on the par-three 16th to get to 11 under.

But Bao Zi showed a keen interest in skateboards, so I decided to nurture this behavior,\\\" Li recalls.\\nBao Zi's skateboarding talent wasn't obvious from the start. Li initially got Bao Zi to deal with a mouse problem in their home.\\n\\\"We had mice running around the ceiling at night, so I got Bao Zi to scare them away,\\\" Li explains.\\nInitially, Bao Zi was just like any other kitten - always looking for food, naps, and cuddles.\\nAt six months old, Bao Zi had a daring \\\"runaway\\\" adventure.\\nLi searched the neighborhood for a week, thinking Bao Zi was gone for good, but the little adventurer came back on his own. That's when Li realized Bao Zi loved exploring the outdoors.\\nThe making of a skateboarding cat\\nIf you've seen Bao Zi's skateboarding videos, you'll know he's a bold and playful kitty.\\n\\\"Bao Zi loves it when I take him out for adventures. At home, he's a lazy furball, but at the skatepark, he's a different cat - confident and daring, weaving through crowds with ease,\\\" says Li.\\nThis unique bond led Li to delve into cat behaviour training. To date, he has trained 13 cats to use the toilet, complete with flushing!\\nBao Zi can also perform a range of tricks, from sitting and shaking paws to playing dead, rolling over, jumping, climbing, going through hoops, pressing doorbells, pushing rolling barrels, and even dribbling a basketball.\\nBut skateboarding took the longest - an entire year of training.\\nAn unbelievable achievement\\nLi thinks Bao Zi's achievement is incredible. \\\"My friends and Bao Zi's fans have been incredibly supportive throughout this challenge,\\\" he said.\\nFor me, Bao Zi's presence is extraordinary. He\\u2019s like a ray of light in the darkness.\\n\\\"Every day, we receive messages of love and blessings from fans around the world. I want to thank everyone who supports and loves Bao Zi. Bringing joy to so many people makes this journey truly meaningful.\\\"\\nBao Zi's story shows the deep bond between pets and their humans. We can't wait to see what other amazing feats this skateboarding cat will achieve in the future!\\nWant more?

That is the American Dream. Gina\\u2019s mother came to this country to work for that dream, and Gina has defended that dream in uniform as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force.\\nIn Congress, Gina will make creating good-paying jobs in Texas her number one priority \\u2014 focusing on investing in small businesses to put Texas at the forefront of job creation and innovation. Gina will protect and create the economic opportunities needed to ensure we have a strong and growing middle class.\\nNATIONAL SECURITY\\nA former military intelligence officer and Iraq War veteran with an extensive career as a national security expert, Gina has spent over 14 years serving and protecting our country. She has the knowledge and experience to be a leader on national security and foreign policy decisions that strengthen our relationships with our allies and protect the long-term interests of the United States. More than ever, we need leaders in Congress who are capable of getting ahead of challenges our country is facing \\u2013 both foreign and domestic.\\nRESPONSIBLE IMMIGRATION REFORM\\nAs a first-generation American, Gina will never forget that our country was built by immigrants and that immigration strengthens our economy and contributes to our national security. Gina knows we need smart, responsible immigration policy reform that protects the security of Americans while also creating an inclusive and welcoming community for those who come to this country for a better life. Gina will work to ensure our immigration policies focus on tapping into our country\\u2019s potential \\u2013 not forcing vulnerable communities into the shadows.\\nIn Congress, Gina will advocate for justly-administered, orderly, and welcoming immigration policies. Our nation\\u2019s border security cannot be compromised, but our safety does not require us to abandon the principles on which this country was founded.\\nACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE\\nTexas continues to have the highest rate of people without health insurance of any state in the country -- about one in every six residents. Texas\\u2019 23rd Congressional District is one of the most medically-underserved districts in the country. Out of 29 counties, there are 18 with three or less doctors and three with no doctors at all. We need to increase access to quality health care and lower the cost of prescription drugs while maintaining Texans\\u2019 ability to keep their private health insurance plans if they choose to.\\nGina watched as her mother faced a diagnosis of colon cancer and understands that her mother\\u2019s survival was possible because of the health care coverage she had as a public school teacher. Gina also realizes that too many families are just one medical emergency away from years of financial hardship or bankruptcy. Finally, Gina is ready to lead the fight to ensure having a child in Texas is no longer a matter of life and death for the mother because Texas should do better than leading the developed world in maternal mortality.\\nIn Congress, Gina will make lower-cost, accessible, quality health care for every American -- regardless of sex, age, income, or employment status -- a top priority. Gina supports universal health care and believes a public option is the best way to help achieve that.\\nQUALITY EDUCATION\\nTexas\\u2019 educational system continues to be ranked among the bottom in the country \\u2013 41st in Education Week\\u2019s 2019 Quality Counts Report \\u2013 yet enrollment in Texas schools continues to rise, with one in every 10 school-age child in America residing in Texas.\\nAs the daughter of a lifelong educator, Gina understands that a quality education is the key to a better future. Gina knows she wouldn\\u2019t be where she is today without the educators who helped guide her and the opportunities her education provided. Unfortunately, as pivotal as quality education is to future economic security and success, Texas ranks 41st nationwide in classroom spending.\\nIn Congress, Gina will fight to ensure every Texas student has access to a first-class public school education and the resources they need. Gina\\u2019s high school had a graduation rate of less than 60 percent. This is too common in Texas, and we must do better.\\nPROTECTING OUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS\\nThroughout her career, Gina has seen first-hand the dangers associated with the hollowing out of government institutions, attacks on the free press, policies deliberately aimed at weakening the voice of women and other marginalized groups, and the threats posed by leaders who use their position as an opportunity to enrich themselves rather than invest in their people. She has seen those who are supposed to be leading this country threaten the freedoms and ideals she spent her lifetime protecting, and Gina once again feels called to serve her country and community and defend those who need it most.\\nAs an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, Gina served under the military\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t Ask, Don\\u2019t Tell\\u201d policy and saw first-hand how discrimination affects good order and discipline, as well as military readiness.\\nIn Congress, Gina will be a champion for equal rights for all and protections from discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, and religion.\\nHIGHER EDUCATION AND SKILLED JOB TRAINING\\nGina was able to attend college because of a four-year Air Force R.O.T.C. scholarship she earned in high school. She believes that every Texas student deserves the opportunity to pursue a higher education if they choose without having to take on a lifetime of debt. Too many talented students give up on getting a college degree because of the burden of student loan debt, while many others are struggling to get out from under it.\\nGina also knows that not every student\\u2019s path to success is through a college classroom and believes leaders should value and support their work, as well. Many who fought alongside her in the military gained high-level skill training that put them on the path to a successful future. We need to value skilled workers and ensure that we have an economy that rewards their hard work. Gina will work to increase the accessibility of specialized job training and vocational programs that give students the skills they need to get good-paying jobs in today\\u2019s economy.\\nFIGHTING FOR OUR VETERANS\\nAs an Iraq War veteran, Gina knows the importance of caring for our veterans and their families. Gina gets her own care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and understands we need a VA with the focus and resources to provide the best possible care for our veterans.\\nWe must serve those who have served us. Gina will stand up for our veterans and their families to ensure our country lives up to the promises we made to them in exchange for their service and their lives. When it comes to our veterans, the quality of their care \\u2014 not profits \\u2014 should be the only motivating factor. \\u200b\\nPROTECTING OUR SENIORS\\nTexas seniors are men and women who worked their whole lives to support their families, and Gina believes strongly that we owe them the dignity of a secure retirement. That means we must protect the safety nets seniors were promised would be there for them \\u2014 programs to which they spent their entire lives contributing. She will fight to protect and expand critical programs that many Texas seniors rely on like Social Security and Medicare.\\n[8]\\n\\u201d\\n\\u2014Gina Ortiz Jones\\u2019 campaign website (2020)\\n[9]\\n2018\\nCampaign website\\nJones' campaign website stated the following:\\nCreating Jobs and Growing the Economy\\nEvery family in this country deserves the opportunity to make a decent living, have a real chance to get ahead, and see their children get a first-class education that gives them more opportunities than those before them \\u2013 that is the American Dream. Gina\\u2019s mother came to this country to work for that dream, and Gina, along with so many others, has defended that dream in uniform.\\nIn Congress, Gina will make creating good paying jobs in Texas her number one priority - focusing on investing in small businesses and the economy to make sure Texas is at the forefront of job creation and innovation. Gina will protect and create the economic opportunities needed to ensure we have a strong middle class.\\nNational Security\\nMore than ever, we need leaders in Congress who are capable of getting ahead of challenges our country is facing \\u2013 both foreign and domestic. A former military intelligence officer and Iraq War veteran with an extensive career as a national security expert, Gina has spent over 14 years serving and protecting our country. She has the knowledge and experience to be a leader on national security and foreign policy decisions that strengthen our relationships with our allies and protect the long-term interests of the United States.\\nRather than the reactionary rhetoric we\\u2019ve seen from Republicans or the alarming and ill-tempered threats issued from our President, Gina will bring high-level experience and unique perspective having served in positions around the world and in our own government. She will stand up for responsible solutions that protect Americans from dangers both at home and abroad. She will be a strong voice to protect the building blocks that truly make our country secure \\u2013 access to quality education and affordable health care services for all Americans. And because our safety begins at home, Gina believes strongly in commonsense measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, and other people who represent a risk to themselves and others.\\nResponsible Immigration Reform\\nAs a first-generation American, Gina will never forget that our country was built by immigrants and that immigration strengthens our economy and contributes to our national security. Gina understands we need smart, responsible immigration policy reform that protects the security of Americans while also creating an inclusive and welcoming community for those who come to this country for a better life.\\nIn Congress, Gina will advocate for justly-administered, orderly, and welcoming immigration policies. Our nation\\u2019s border security cannot be compromised, but our safety does not require us to abandon the principles on which this country was founded.\\nAccessible Affordable Healthcare\\nThe importance of affordable and accessible health care services is particularly critical in Texas, which continues to have the highest rate of people without health insurance of any state in the country - about one in every six residents.\\nGina watched as her mother faced a diagnosis of colon cancer and understands that her mother\\u2019s survival was possible because of the health care coverage she had as a public employee. Gina also realizes that too many families are just one medical emergency away from years of financial hardship or bankruptcy. Finally, Gina is ready to lead the fight to ensure having a child in Texas is no longer a matter of life and death for the mother. Texas can do better than leading the developed world in maternal mortality, and that starts with sending folks like Gina to Washington.\\nIn Congress, Gina will make affordable, accessible, quality healthcare for every American - regardless of sex, age, income, or employment status - a top priority. Gina supports a single payer system and understands that with our country's health, there can only be one incentive: a healthy population.\\nQuality Education\\nTexas\\u2019 educational system continues to be ranked among the bottom in the country \\u2013 43rd in Education Week\\u2019s 2016 Quality Counts Report \\u2013 yet enrollment in Texas schools continues to rise, with one in every 10 school age child in this country residing in Texas.\\nAs the daughter of a lifelong educator, Gina understands that a quality education is the key to a better future. She knows she wouldn\\u2019t be where she is today without the educators who helped guide her and the opportunities her education provided. Unfortunately, as pivotal as quality education is to future economic security and success, Texas ranks 36th nationwide in classroom spending.\\nIn Congress, Gina will fight to ensure every Texas student has access to a first-class education and the resources they need. Gina graduated from the kind of high school where you start off with 900 kids, yet only 500 graduate. This is too common in Texas, and we have to do better. She\\u2019s ready to fight for our kids - regardless of their background or zipcode.\\nProtecting our Civil Rights and Freedoms\\nThroughout her career, Gina has seen first-hand the dangers associated with the hollowing out of government institutions, attacks on the free press, policies deliberately aimed at weakening the voice of women and other marginalized groups, and the threats posed by leaders who use their position as an opportunity to turn a profit rather than develop a nation. She has seen those who are supposed to be leading this country threaten the freedoms and ideals she spent her lifetime protecting, and Gina once again feels called to serve her country and community and defend those who need it most.\\nAs an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force, Gina served under the military\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t Ask, Don\\u2019t Tell\\u201d policy and saw first-hand how discrimination affects good order and discipline, as well as military readiness.\\nIn Congress, Gina will be a champion for equal rights for all and protections from discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, and religion.\\nHigher Education and Skilled Job Training\\nGina was able to attend Boston University because of a four-year Air Force R.O.T.C. scholarship she earned in high school. She believes that every Texas student deserves the opportunity to pursue a higher education if they choose, not only if they can afford it. Too many talented students give up on getting a college degree because of the burden of student loan debt, while many others are struggling to get out from under it. Gina also knows that not every student\\u2019s path to success is through a college classroom, many that fought alongside her in the military gained high-level skill training that put them on the path to a successful future.\\nIn Congress, Gina will fight to ensure every Texas student has access to quality, affordable higher education. She will also work to increase the accessibility of specialized job training and vocational programs that give students the skills they need to get good-paying jobs in today\\u2019s economy.\\nProtecting Our Seniors and Veterans\\nAs an Iraq War veteran, Gina knows how egregious it is that so many of those who served before and with her, and put their lives on the line to protect all of us, are seemingly forgotten and not receiving the care they deserve.\\nGina believes strongly that we owe Texas seniors \\u2013 men and women who worked their whole lives to support their families \\u2013 the dignity of a secure retirement. This includes the safety nets they were promised would be there for them, and to which they spent their entire lives contributing.\\nIn Congress, Gina will stand up for our veterans and their families to ensure our country lives up to the promises we made to them in exchange for their service and their lives. She will fight to protect critical programs that many Texas seniors rely on like Social Security and Medicare.\\n[10]\\nCampaign advertisements\\nThe following is an example of an ad from Jones' 2018 election campaign.\\n\\\"No One Had to Ask\\\" - released July 12, 2018\\nSee also\\n2025 Elections\\nWhat's on the ballot?\\nU.S. Congress special elections\\nState executives\\nState legislatures\\nState courts\\nBallot measures\\nMunicipal government\\nSchool boards\\nElection analysis hub\\nGovernment\\nWho represents me?\\nU.S. Congress\\nState executives\\nState legislators\\nState courts\\nBallot measures\\nMunicipal government\\nSchool boards\\nNewsletters\\nThe Daily Brew\\nThe Weekly Brew\\nThe Ballot Bulletin\\nChecks and Balances\\nEconomy and Society\\nHall Pass\\nNumber of the Day\\nRobe & Gavel\\nUnion Station\\nExternal links\\nSearch Google News for this topic\\nCandidate\\nMayor of San Antonio\\nFacebook\\nYouTube\\nWebsite\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\nPersonal\\nFacebook\\nFootnotes\\n\\u2191\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.2\\nU.S. Department of War\\n, \\\"Gina Ortiz Jones,\\\" accessed October 17, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nInside Elections\\n, \\\"Candidate Conversation - Gina Ortiz Jones (D),\\\" December 1, 2017\\n\\u2191\\nNew York Times\\n, \\\"Gina Ortiz Jones, a Progressive, Is Elected San Antonio\\u2019s Mayor,\\\" June 7, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nThe Hill\\n, \\\"Democrats fend off GOP in San Antonio mayor runoff election,\\\" June 7, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nGina Ortiz Jones For Mayor\\n, \\\"Priorities,\\\" accessed October 17, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nTexas Public Radio\\n, \\\"Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones on her first 100 days,\\\" October 1, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nSan Antonio Report\\n, \\\"'I\\u2019m focused on the people, not the petty': Mayor Jones hopes to unite council after months of skirmishes,\\\" October 14, 2025\\n\\u2191\\nNote: This text is quoted verbatim from the original source.

21st tour-level title in Hangzhou. By Sam Jacot\\n\\n[Marin Cilic](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/marin-cilic/c977/overview) is\\nan ATP Tour champion once again. The Croatian overcame Chinese star [Zhang\\nZhizhen](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/zhizhen-zhang/z371/overview)\\n7-6(5), 7-6(5) on Tuesday at the Hangzhou Open to clinch his first tour-level\\ntitle since 2021.\\n\\nThe 35-year-old wild card was competing in his first tour-level event since\\nBuenos Aires in February and arrived in Chengdu at No. 777 in the PIF ATP\\nRankings. However, Cilic looked sharp throughout his run at the ATP 250,\\ndropping just two sets to become the lowest-ranked champion in the ATP Tour\\nhistory (since 1990).\\n\\n\\\"Thank you to my family, my boys, my wife. Everyone who has been with me in\\nthis difficult period,\\\" Cilic said during the trophy ceremony. \\\"Working with\\nme day by day, pushing me and giving me strength and spirit. I am so happy and\\nproud to make this victory not only for me but for them too.\\\"\\n\\n> Mar-in the winner's circle \\ud83e\\udd29[@marincilic](https://twitter.com/MarinCilic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s comeback is complete with his first title since 2021![@HangzhouOpen](https://twitter.com/HangzhouOpen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) | [#HangzhouOpen](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HangzhouOpen?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/6Sq0UIJ7Qf](https://t.co/6Sq0UIJ7Qf)\\n>\\n> -- ATP Tour (@atptour) [September 24,\\n> 2024](https://twitter.com/atptour/status/1838571979542004098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nIn the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, there was little to separate\\nCilic and home favourite Zhang, with both players saving both break points\\nthey faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The former World No. 3 Cilic\\nplayed more aggressively in the two tie-breaks and fired 34 winners in the\\nmatch compared to 26 from Zhang to triumph on the ATP Tour for the first time\\nsince he won St. Petersburg in 2021.\\n\\nCilic, who missed several months of 2024 due to a knee injury, has now won 21\\ntour-level crowns and enjoyed title success in 13 different seasons.

won in 2021\\nPublished\\n11 August 2024\\nToprak Razgatlioglu set a record for the most consecutive World Superbike race wins as he clinched two more victories in Portugal to extend his unbeaten run to 13.\\nThe Turkish rider, 27, broke the existing record when he took Superpole victory in Sunday's opening race in Portimao.\\nFor good measure, Razgatlioglu then won Race Two at the Algarve circuit to increase his World Championship advantage to 92 points after Alvaro Bautista crashed with four laps remaining as he was battling for the lead with the BMW rider.\\nRazgatlioglu had also to hold off a late challenge from Nicolo Bulega before taking a narrow victory as Great Britain's Alex Lowes secured his second third-place finish of the day.\\nBautista, in 2019 and last year, and Northern Ireland's six-times champion Jonathan Rea in 2018, had previously secured 11 straight World Superbike race wins.\\nRazgatlioglu dominates Superpole race\\nIn the Superpole Race, Razgatlioglu produced another dominant ride on his BMW to finish nearly three seconds clear of Danilo Petrucci, with Lowes completing the podium positions.\\nMichael van der Mark, Bulega and Bautista completed the top six with Rea finishing in 10th place.\\nIn Race Two, Lowes and Van der Mark had stints in the lead before the Turkish rider moved ahead by lap six.\\nA charging Bautista moved ahead of Lowes into second spot on lap eight but Razgatlioglu still had a comfortable looking 1.394 second advantage by half distance.\\nHowever, the defending champion steadily chipped away at Razgatlioglu's advantage and briefly moved into the lead with four laps remaining only to almost immediately slide off after the runaway championship pacesetter had regained a narrow advantage.\\nAs Bulega and Lowes took the other podium positions, Andrea Iannone, Petrucci and Rea completed the top six.\\nRazgatlioglu's 92-point advantage over Bulega in the series makes him a huge favourite to regain the title he won in

He was the top performer in all three rounds.\\n\\u201cI definitely felt like there was more pressure this year than the previous two years,\\u201d Nolan Jukish said. \\u201cEveryone in the top five is capable of winning it.\\u201d\\nMore from Conrad\\nHigh School Football: Pierz stomps Esko to setup area matchup in section final\\n2d ago\\nHigh School Football: No. 5 Sauk Rapids upsets No. 4 Warriors\\n6d ago\\nVolleyball: No. 8-seeded Brainerd knocks out No.9-seeded Lumberjacks\\nOct 20\\nGabe Jukish, 19, finished second and scored 31 points.\\n\\u201cIt was really fun to take first and second place,\\u201d Gabe Jukish said. \\u201cI did what I was expected to do. The only thing that was a little harder was that I had to ride a jet ski I wasn\\u2019t as comfortable on.\\u201d\\nThe Pro Freestyle World Finals consists of three rounds across two days. The first two rounds are worth 10 points each and the final round is worth double.\\nGabe Jukish ranked second in the final round and received 17 points to leapfrog him from third to second.\\nNolan Jukish performs a trick during the International Jet Sports Boating Association Pro Freestyle World Finals Oct. 6-12 in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\\nTyler Reardon\\nNolan Jukish\\u2019s 40 points were a perfect score.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\u201cIt was reassuring,\\u201d Nolan Jukish said. \\u201cGoing into the final round, I had quite a lead in points. I knew that it would be hard for some people to make a comeback once I was so far in front.\\u201d\\nThe move Nolan Jukish credits for his high scores is the double backflip.\\n\\u201cI strung together two double backflips in a row during the final round,\\u201d he said.\\nWhile the double backflip helped Nolan Jukish win, his older brother was the first American to perform the double backflip in competition.\\nGabe Jukish performs tricks during the International Jet Sports Boating Association Pro Freestyle World Finals in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\\nTyler Reardon\\n\\u201cI try to go high and do a lot of hands and feet off the jet ski,\\u201d Gabe Jukish said. \\u201cI do a lot of combos where I string together tricks and try to keep busy the whole run, so people have something to watch the whole time. My favorite trick is the double backflip.\\u201d\\nTrying new tricks, like a double backflip, can be scary at first.\\n\\u201cI definitely get scared when I try a new trick just because I\\u2019ve never done it before,\\u201d Nolan Jukish said. \\u201cBut as far as stuff I do daily, it doesn\\u2019t scare me anymore.\\u201d\\nADVERTISEMENT\\nGabe Jukish graduated from Brainerd High School in 2024.

I have the next best guy in the world with me all summer, just training and working on jet skis and learning. It\\u2019s really nice to have somebody to push me and help me learn. We help each other out a lot. There is not any sort of beef or anything. We stay with each other all week while we\\u2019re at the World Finals.

Seeing my brother win the last few years and seeing him learn the tricks that I\\u2019ve been able to do has been fun.\\u201d\\nNolan and Gabe compete in three to four events a year. This year, they only competed in the World Finals since they were already qualified. In the winter, they sometimes make trips to Daytona Beach, Florida, to watch surfing and practice. There is also a pond near their lakes area home that thaws quickly in the spring, which is used as a practice area.\\n\\u201cWe might go to Florida, but I have more fun snowmobiling in the winter,\\u201d Gabe Jukish said. \\u201cI just train hard in the summer with jet skiing when it\\u2019s nice (in the lakes area).\\u201d\\nNolan Jukish added: \\u201cIt\\u2019s been really fun to travel around and get to jet ski with different people and meet new people.

Since the LCS was only launched in the third year of professional play, it was dubbed \\\"Season 3\\\". The top three finishers in the Riot Games European regional championships held in August 2012 automatically qualified, with the remaining five teams being decided in qualifier tournaments held in January 2013. Each LCS season is divided into two splits for spring and summer; the first games of the first spring split took place on 7 February 2013 in North America and on 9 February 2013 in Europe.\\nSeason 3 of the LCS finished with the top three finishers\\nFnatic\\n, Lemondogs, and\\nGambit Gaming\\n. The top three teams advanced to the\\nSeason 3 World Championships\\n.\\nRiot Games changed naming conventions in 2014, calling the season the \\\"2014 Season\\\" instead of \\\"Season 4\\\". The\\nLeague of Legends Challenger Series\\nwas created as a second tier of competition for\\npromotion and relegation\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nAt the end of the 2014 season, an expansion tournament was held in Europe that added two teams in region, giving the LCS a total of 10 teams for the start of the 2015 Season.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nAdditionally, Riot introduced the concept of \\\"Championship points\\\", which teams would earn based on performance across both splits and playoffs in order to qualify for the\\nLeague of Legends World Championship\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nA new sale of sponsorship rule was instated for the 2015 season. As a result, several teams were forced to rebrand and leave their respective parent organisations.\\nThe 2015 Summer European LCS Finals were played at\\nHovet Arena\\n,\\nStockholm\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nThe series ended with\\nFnatic\\nwinning 3\\u20132 over\\nOrigen\\nand peaked at close to 1 million concurrent viewers on\\nTwitch\\n,\\nYouTube\\n, and\\nAzubu\\n\\u2013 the highest number of viewers for any LCS match to date.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe 2016 Spring European LCS finals were held at\\nRotterdam Ahoy\\nin\\nRotterdam\\n, with\\nG2\\nwinning 3\\u20131 against Origen, making it their first LCS title.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe 2016 Spring European LCS split was the first time G2 played in the professional LCS after having been promoted due to winning the European Challenger Series and European Promotion Tournament in summer 2016.\\nThe 2016 Summer European LCS finals were played at the\\nTauron Arena\\nin\\nKrak\\u00f3w\\n,\\nPoland\\n.

The EU LCS' secondary league, the EU Challenger Series (EUCS), was consequently discontinued and replaced with an independent tournament named European Masters, which features the top teams from Europe's many regional leagues.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nIn 2020, the league announced via their public Twitter account a partnership with a proposed\\nSaudi Arabian\\ncity,\\nNeom\\n. Following major community backlash over the\\nhuman rights abuses in the country\\n, including criminalization of LGBT people, the partnership was called off the next day.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nAnother two days later, the league's Director of Esports EMEA, Alberto Guerrero, put out a statement apologizing to the community for the partnership decision, with emphasis on apologizing to 'women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and League of Legends players in the Middle East'.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nSince 2023,\\nTurkey\\n,\\nCIS\\nand\\nMENA\\nhave merged with Europe region to become a EMEA (\\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa\\n) region.

TCL will be a qualification of Tier-2 league EMEA Masters.\\nTrophy\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe LEC Trophy was designed by DesignStudio and manufactured by English silverware company,\\nThomas Lyte\\n.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nThe design was inspired by the format of the tournament and its ten competing teams.

Tour golf nerd. World No.1 at three-putting.\\nLast updated:\\n10 February 2025\\nShane Lowry made the lowest score in Major history as he shot 61 at the PGA Championship.\\nShane Lowry writes his name in the history books as he becomes the fourth player to shoot 62 in a Major Championship.\\nThe Irishman took full advantage of moving day at the\\nPGA Championship\\nat Valhalla, as he produced the best putting round of his career to fire a blemish-free nine-under-par 62 to fire himself into contention for his second Major title.\\nWhile\\nLowry\\nwill be delighted with his performance, he was left rueing a missed opportunity to break the scoring record and make the first 61. The 37-year-old saw a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole drop agonizingly low of the hole.\\n\\u201cI enjoyed every minute of it, obviously,\\u201d he said after the round. \\u201c(But I\\u2019m) Probably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62. I knew what was at stake. I just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a good read and just broke away from the hole.\\n\\u201cI went out there with a job to do today, and my job was to try to get myself back in the tournament, and I definitely did that.\\u201d\\nThe 2019 Open Champion\\u2019s 62 is the fifth in Major Championship history and came just two days after\\nXander Schauffele became the first man to record two rounds of 62\\nin Majors. Schauffele had previously achieved the feat at Los Angeles Country Club in the 2023 US Open.\\nWhile Branden Grace and Rickie Fowler led the way as the first two men to make 62s in Majors, Lowry and Schauffele\\u2019s performances at\\nValhalla\\nare arguably more impressive due to the course\\u2019s higher par (71). Royal Birkdale, where Grace made the first 62 in Major history in 2017, and Los Angeles CC, where Fowler made the second (just minutes before Schauffele made the third) both had pars of 70.\\nLowry, whose previous best score at one of the big four events had been a 63 on his way to\\nvictory at The Open at Royal Portrush\\n, reached the turn in 29 having drained putt after putt on a week when he leads all of the stats on the greens. A further three birdies followed as he reached the final tee in 57 blows knowing he needed to make a four on the par-5 18th to take the record alone.\\nThe Ryder Cup star found the rough from the tee, forcing him to lay up and rely on his magical short game. He put his approach to 20 feet but held his head in anguish as the downhill putt turned late in its journey and came to rest just inches to the left of the hole.\\nPlaying alongside\\nJustin Rose\\n, who shot a seven-under 64, to give himself the chance of becoming the first Englishman to win the title since Jim Barnes in 1919, Lowry got off to a flying start, making birdies at the 2\\nnd\\n, 3\\nrd\\n, 4\\nth\\n, and 5\\nth\\nholes to rocket up the leaderboard.\\nThe run ended at the 6\\nth\\nbut he managed two more by the turn, taking advantage of the par-5 7\\nth\\nbefore holing a 17-footer at the par-4 9\\nth\\nto reach the turn in 29 shots.\\nThe pace slowed on the back nine, but birdies at 13 and 14 briefly saw Lowry jump into a share of the lead. He joined the lead again with another red number at the par-4 17th before Xander Schauffele again nipped ahead, but Lowry will head into Sunday with high hopes of winning his second Major title. If he does he\\u2019ll become just the fifth European to win the PGA Championship, joining Barnes, Padraig Harrington, Martin Kaymer, and Rory McIlroy.\\nAs well as equalling the record for the lowest Major round, Lowry joins Schauffele as Valhalla\\u2019s course record holder. The previous record \\u2013 a 63 by Jose Maria Olazabal in the PGA Championship \\u2013 had stood for 24 years before Schauffele\\u2019s first-round heroics.\\nEverything Shane Lowry said after his 62\\nAfter his record-equalling round, Shane Lowry joined the media to discuss his 62 and hopes of lifting the Wanamaker Trophy for a first time.\\nTHE MODERATOR: Shane Lowry is with us at the 106th PGA Championship. A 62 today. How would you summarize that performance?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every minute of it, obviously. Probably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62. I knew what was at stake. Just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a good read and just broke away from the hole. Look, I went out there with a job to do today, and my job was to try to get myself back in the tournament, and I definitely did that.\\nQ. Best putting round of your career. What do you credit it to?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I don\\u2019t know, to be honest. I changed my putter at the Zurich Classic, and even there like if I had have putted well, I think me and Rory would have won by a few. I feel like I\\u2019ve sort of changed up how I\\u2019ve been practicing the last two weeks, sort of getting away from the technical side of it and just trying to hole putts and just doing a lot of drills. But yeah, it\\u2019s nice to finally see a few going in the hole because it\\u2019s been a slow year for me on the greens. It\\u2019s been nice to see it this week. Look, when I got here, I saw the greens. The greens are beautiful. They\\u2019re a nice pace to hole putts. It was nice to see a few going in.\\nQ. Did you have a number in mind today?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I thought if I could get to double digits, that was my plan. If I could shoot 65, I felt like I\\u2019d be there\\u2013 I\\u2019d obviously need another at least 65 tomorrow if I did that. But that\\u2019s what I wanted to do. But obviously a few better is nice.\\nQ. It looked like a fried egg on 10 but not the normal kind. Can you walk us through that there?\\nSHANE LOWRY: How disappointing was that? I mean, I was on such \\u2014 you know, I was on such \\u2014 my momentum was there. I was on a good run, and I hit a great second shot straight at the flag. Obviously just come up a few yards short. But it\\u2019s kind of where I was trying to hit it in that bunker because I knew I could get it up-and-down, and it pitched in the bunker. Obviously rolled up the face and rolled back in its pitch mark. It was interesting. And then I felt like it was just going to come out soft, and it come flying out of it. But yeah, that was disappointing. But I had a nice up-and-down there, which kept me going.\\nQ. I want to ask you how important is it do you feel now to put yourself in the position that you\\u2019re now in going into Sunday, and what would potentially a second major title mean to you to add to your glittering trophy cabinet?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Obviously you come here the start of every major championship, and you know what it means to win one of theme. I\\u2019ve been fortunate to do it before, and to win one is pretty good, but to win multiple, you\\u2019re kind of a bit of a different level. Yeah, it would mean a lot to me tomorrow. Obviously, look, there\\u2019s a long way between now and that. We\\u2019ll see what Xander does and Collin does on the back nine today first, and then we\\u2019ll go out tomorrow, and hopefully I can -I\\u2019ll just go out and give my best. I go out and fight hard. I\\u2019ve been in this position a few times before, learned from the sort of Oakmont and tournaments like that and brought that into Portrush, and hopefully I can bring some of that with me tomorrow and just give it everything.\\nQ. Can you just tell me as someone who will never, ever know what it\\u2019s like to line up a putt for a round of 61, what exactly is going through your mind? What are you thinking?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I knew I just really wanted to hole it. Probably too much. Yeah, it was just \\u2014 I kind of stood back and allowed myself to enjoy the moment. It was a pretty cool moment to have. It would have been a pretty cool moment to kind of seal the deal and do it. But at the end of the day, I knew even if I didn\\u2019t do it that I done what I needed to do today, and I\\u2019m pretty happy with that.\\nQ. With what Justin was doing on the front nine, have you ever played so well and not taken the honor on the tee?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I know. I said that to him on the \\u2014 I think it was walking off the 5th green. I\\u2019m like, What am I going to have to do to get the honor off you today. Yeah, it was pretty cool out there, the two of us. He obviously had a great round, as well, and he\\u2019s put himself in there tomorrow, and we both played great. It was nice to kind of bounce off each other and feed off each other the whole day.\\nQ. Just interested more in the psychology of that potential 61. How early was that in your mind as something that could happen, and how if at all does that influence you?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, when you go out in 29, you think, wow, I have a good day going here, and you have 10 that\\u2019s a pretty gettable par-5. I think when I holed the putt on 14, I was like, here we go, yeah, this is a good chance. But obviously 15 is a tricky hole and 16 is a tough hole. But it felt like I played them very well. Obviously to birdie 17, that\\u2019s when I knew I just really wanted to hit a good tee shot on the last. I pushed it a little bit and laid it up, and I hit a great wedge shot, and yeah, obviously just missed the putt. Yeah, it was in my mind from about 14 onwards.\\nQ. It looked as if you looked straight up 18 as if you were going to hit \\u2013\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the ball was kind of sitting up in the rough. I had 170 yards from the fairway to the other side of the water, and I probably could have done it, but it felt like it was maybe a silly decision to go for it under the circumstances. I knew if I made 5 that I\\u2019m still in the tournament. If I made 6, I\\u2019d be livid with myself. I felt like it was probably a bit too risky to take on. I hit a poor lay-up to be honest, and I got fortunate that it was in the semi-rough, and I had a perfect number from there. And I hit a great shot then after that.\\nQ. Leading up to this week, did you see anything in your game specifically that might have fore shadowed something like this? What was clicking for you?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I feel like tee-to-green, I\\u2019ve been as good as I\\u2019ve ever been this year, and then I come out the first two days, it was probably the worst I\\u2019ve played in a long time, but my putter kept me going and kept me in the tournament. Then I went to the range with my coach yesterday afternoon and sort of \\u2014 it was just an alignment issue. I was set up too far left and all sorts of bad things happen for me when I do that. Yeah, fixed that, and went out there today, played with a little bit of freedom, and managed to do that score. Yeah, I\\u2019ve sort of felt all season that if I could warm my putter up that I could be dangerous. I kept saying it. Here I am going out in one of the last groups tomorrow, one of the last few groups tomorrow with a chance in this tournament. That\\u2019s nice. Regardless of what happens tomorrow, it\\u2019s a nice position to be in.\\nQ. When is the last time you were this satisfied after a round? Seems like there\\u2019s a pretty good smile you can\\u2019t wipe off your face.\\nSHANE LOWRY: To be honest, I said to my coach, my agent after the first two rounds, the last two days, I feel like I\\u2019ve gotten a lot out of my golf this week. I played poorly the first two days I felt, got a lot out of the rounds, and it\\u2019s been a while since I\\u2019ve felt like that. It\\u2019s a nice feeling to have. Going to enjoy it and kind of get out tomorrow and then just try and do it again.\\nQ. Were you a little surprised the leaders didn\\u2019t push out a little farther yesterday afternoon, and did that give you a little jump start knowing that you weren\\u2019t as far back as you started? Then how does the mindset change tomorrow after knowing you needed to go low today?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Somebody asked me this question after the first \\u2014 maybe it was yesterday. Like it happens every week on the PGA TOUR. Somebody goes low the first day and everyone thinks 25-under is going to win or 20-under is going to win. It doesn\\u2019t work like that. It\\u2019s a four-round event, and it takes a lot to get to the 72nd hole on Sunday. I sort of felt like they weren\\u2019t going to go too far away. Obviously the leaders have played some really solid golf and had some really good scores, but there are a lot of difficult holes out there, as well. Albeit it\\u2019s soft and there\\u2019s not much wind, if you play good it\\u2019s scorable, but if you hit a bad shot, you\\u2019re going to get in trouble. If you hit an average shot you could get in trouble, as well. What am I going to \\u2014 what was the \\u2013\\nQ. Tomorrow\\u2019s mindset. You go low today\\nSHANE LOWRY: I just have to \\u2014 look, I\\u2019m going to enjoy this round. I\\u2019ll go back, put my feet up tonight, have some dinner, hopefully get some sleep and get out there and just fight hard tomorrow and go out and give it my best.\\nQ. Following up on the question with smiling out there, was there something you took from the Zurich win that might have carried over to today?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Look, it was obviously nice to win in Zurich. But if you had of seen me last week, I wasn\\u2019t smiling on the golf course. It\\u2019s quite hollow when you don\\u2019t get on very well. So yeah, obviously, look, winning at the Zurich Classic was great for a lot of things, FedExCup, stuff like that, just to get another win under my belt. It gives you a lot of confidence. Yeah, it was nice to do that. But then you go on to the next week, and it doesn\\u2019t make a difference what you\\u2019ve done last week. I think that\\u2019s the great thing about this game. It doesn\\u2019t matter what you\\u2019ve done last week, you\\u2019ve still got next week and the week after. Look, even if I go out and win tomorrow or go out and finish 20th tomorrow, we\\u2019ve still got the Canadian Open in a couple of weeks and Memorial and the U.S. Open. Still got a lot to look forward to. Yeah, it was nice to get the win at the Zurich, but you just move on quickly and get on to the next event.\\nQ. What\\u2019s the lowest you\\u2019ve ever shot anywhere, even if it\\u2019s not official? Have you ever shot below 60?\\nSHANE LOWRY: I remember having a chance one day, and I don\\u2019t normally go out and keep scores, but if I get on a run, you sort of think, I\\u2019m actually doing all right here. I think I maybe shot 61 before, 60, 61, but I\\u2019ve never shot below. Actually I\\u2019ve shot 60 before. I had a putt for a 59 before. And I didn\\u2019t make it. (Laughing).\\nQ. We see a lot of guys when they\\u2019re out on the course will try to keep their emotions to a minimum. I think you would be categorized as one of the more emotive players in pro golf. Do you feel like it\\u2019s an asset at all that you kind of wear your heart on your sleeve?\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, I think I\\u2019m doing okay. I think I\\u2019m happy with my career so far, so yeah, I think I\\u2019m doing okay. I\\u2019m not going to change.\\nLowest rounds in men\\u2019s Major history\\nAll the birdies from\\n@BrandenGrace\\n's record-breaking round of 62; the lowest ever in a Major.

on the north inner city through the recent Dublin City Taskforce report,  Mr McAdam said he would be concentrating on the reuse of vacant and derelict buildings, using the compulsory purchase process where building owners were \\u201csquandering\\u201d the city\\u2019s resources by leaving properties to decay.\\nHe also said he wanted to see the council develop \\u201cvacancy maps\\u201d to identify the greatest opportunities for the reuse of buildings.\\nThe implementation of the council\\u2019s sports plan was also vital to the development of the city, he said. \\u201cI think given the

adopted through the city-centre taskforce to put together a long-term vision in terms of how we want the city centre to feel and to look by 2050,\\u201d he said.\\n\\u201cI think it\\u2019s an appropriate time as we come to the end of the first quarter of the century that we look to what we want to achieve for the city centre by the middle point of the 21st century.\\u201d\\nIn a more

In 1991 he graduated in chemistry from the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology of the University of Ljubljana, where he also worked as a young researcher and assistant to Professor Dr Aleksandra Kornhauser Frazer. Under her mentorship, he earned his master\\u2019s degree in Scientific and Technical Informatics in 1994. In 1999 he defended his PhD thesis at Lancaster University Management School (UK). Also in the UK, he earned a PhD degree in 2000, which was officially recognised at the University of Ljubljana in 2001. In 2003, he was tenured as an assistant professor at the University of Ljubljana.\\nDuring his time at the university, Musar worked on various projects for UNESCO, EBRD, UNDP, US EPA and the World Bank, where he was also employed in 1993. In 2000, he joined Aktiva Group, where he managed various projects and was involved in setting up and managing venture capital funds. In 2003, he and his partners founded the S.T. Hammer Group, within which he had a number of responsibilities in the management and control of the group\\u2019s companies. He was a member of supervisory boards and boards of directors of investment and production companies in Slovenia, Belgium, the USA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.\\nIn 2016, after ending his work in the S.T. Hammer Group, Musar bought at auction the cultural monument Russian Dacha in Zgornje Gameljne near Ljubljana, which was in need of major renovation. After being left abandoned and decaying for more than a decade, this beautiful building has regained its glowing appearance of 1908. Today, the villa again appears in the colours it proudly displayed before the First World War. The renovation was carried out in accordance with the conservation plan in cooperation with and under the supervision of the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. The complete renovation of the Russian Dacha, which Musar carried out together with the conservator in charge, Damjana Pedi\\u010dek Terseglav, and the chief conservator, Jo\\u017ee Dre\\u0161ar, brought him the 2020 Stele Prize awarded by the Slovenian Conservation Society.\\nAle\\u0161 Musar is now focusing on the development of the Russian Dacha, redeveloping the villa\\u2019s wider surroundings to create a cultural hub on the outskirts of Ljubljana. As the spouse of the President of Slovenia, he will also be involved in projects to protect and promote Slovenia\\u2019s cultural heritage both at home and abroad.\\nInstagram\\nFacebook\\nTwitter\\nFlickr\\n\\u00a9 2025 President of the Republic of Slovenia\\nAccessibility statement\\nIndex\\nProduction\\nInnovatif\\nClick on the icon to open the cookie banner\\nSL\\nEN\\nClose the navigation pane\\nAbout the president\\nEvents\\nNews\\nEmphases\\nSecondary navigation\\nPresident's Podcast\\nPresident's Forum\\nObjectives of the President\\u2019s term\\nOffice\\nSecondary navigation\\nAdvisers to the President of the Republic\\nPublic relations\\nDecorations\\nSpouse\\nSecondary navigation\\nSpouse's activities\\nPresidential palace\\nSecondary navigation\\nHalls of the Presidential palace\\nPage search\\nPage search\\nClose the search page\"}"}], "step_4": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': 'Ale\u0161 Musar', 'context': 'The current president of Slovenia, Aleksander \u010ceferin, is married to Ale\u0161 Musar, who is involved in cultural heritage projects in Slovenia.
