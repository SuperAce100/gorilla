The airport is currently the\\n5th busiest airport in the United States by cargo traffic\\nand 12th largest in the world. CVG is the fastest-growing cargo airport in North America.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBeginnings\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nPresident\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\n's administration approved preliminary funds for site development of the Greater Cincinnati Airport on February 11, 1942. This was part of the\\nUnited States Army Air Corps\\nprogram to establish training facilities during\\nWorld War II\\n. At the time, air traffic in the area centered on\\nLunken Airport\\njust southeast of central Cincinnati.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nLunken opened in 1926 in the Ohio River Valley; it frequently experienced fog, and the\\n1937 flood\\nsubmerged its runways and two-story terminal building.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nFederal officials wanted an airfield site that would not be prone to flooding, but Cincinnati officials hoped to build Lunken into the region's main airport.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nOfficials from\\nBoone\\n,\\nKenton\\n, and\\nCampbell\\ncounties in Kentucky took advantage of Cincinnati's short-sightedness and lobbied Congress to build an airfield there.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nBoone County officials offered a suitable site on the provision that Kenton County paid the acquisition cost. In October 1942, Congress provided $2 million to build four runways.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nThe field opened August 12, 1944, with the first\\nB-17 bombers\\nbeginning practice runs on August 15. As the tide of the war had already turned, the Air Corps only used the field until it was declared surplus in 1945.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nHowever, this was not before the first regularly scheduled air freight shipment in the United States arrived in mid-September, signalling the future importance of the airport.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nOn October 27, 1946, a small wooden terminal building opened and the airport prepared for commercial service under the name\\nGreater Cincinnati Airport\\n.\\nBoone County Airlines\\nwas the first airline to provide scheduled service from the airport and had its headquarters at the airport.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\na\\n]\\nThe first commercial flight, an\\nAmerican Airlines\\nDC-3\\nfrom Cleveland, landed on January 10, 1947, at 9:53\\u00a0am. A Delta Air Lines flight followed moments later.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 97 weekday departures: 37 American, 26 Delta, 24 TWA, 8 Piedmont, and 2 Lake Central. As late as November 1959 the airport had four 5,500\\u00a0ft (1,700\\u00a0m) runways at 45-degree angles, the north\\u2013south runway eventually being extended into today's runway 18C/36C.\\nIn the 1950s Cincinnati city leaders began pushing for expansion of a site in\\nBlue Ash\\nto both compete with the Greater Cincinnati Airport and replace Lunken as the city's primary airport.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe city purchased Hugh Watson Field in 1955, turning it into\\nBlue Ash Airport\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nThe city's Blue Ash plans were hampered by community opposition, three failed\\nHamilton County\\nbond measures,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\npolitical infighting,\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nand Cincinnati's decision not to participate in the federal airfield program.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nJet age\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain atrium\\nOn December 16, 1960, the jet age arrived in Cincinnati when a Delta Air Lines\\nConvair 880\\nfrom Miami completed the first scheduled jet flight. The airport needed to expand and build more modern terminals and other facilities; the original Terminal A was expanded and renovated. The north\\u2013south runway was extended from 3,100 to 8,600\\u00a0ft (940 to 2,620\\u00a0m). In 1964, the board approved a $12 million bond to expand the south concourse of Terminal A by 32,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft (3,000\\u00a0m\\n2\\n) and provide nine gates for\\nTWA\\n, American, and Delta.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nA new east\\u2013west runway crossing the longer north\\u2013south runway was constructed in 1971 south of the older east\\u2013west runway.\\nIn 1977, before the\\nAirline Deregulation Act\\nwas passed, CVG, like many small airports, anticipated the loss of numerous flights; creating the opportunity for Patrick Sowers, Robert Tranter, and David and Raymound Mueller to establish\\nComair\\nto fill the void. The airline began service to Akron/Canton, Cleveland, and Evansville. In 1981, Comair became a public company, added 30-seat turboprops to its fleet, and began to rapidly expand its destinations. In 1984, Comair became a\\nDelta Connection\\ncarrier with\\nDelta's\\nestablishment of a hub at CVG. That same year, Comair introduced its first international flights from Cincinnati to Toronto. In 1992, Comair moved into Concourse C, as Delta Air Lines gradually continued to acquire more of the airline's stock. In 1993, Comair was the launch customer for the\\nCanadair Regional Jet\\n, of which it would later operate the largest fleet in the world. By 1999, Comair was the largest regional airline in the country worth over $2 billion, transporting 6 million passengers yearly to 83 destinations on 101 aircraft. Later that year, Delta Air Lines acquired the remaining portion of Comair's stock, causing Comair to solely operate Delta Connection flights.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn 1988, two founders of Comair, Patrick Sowers and Robert Tranter launched a new scheduled airline from CVG named\\nEnterprise Airlines\\n, which served 16 cities at its peak. The airline spearheaded the regional jet revolution in a unique manner by operating 10-seat\\nCessna Citation\\nbusiness jets in scheduled services. The flights became popular with Cincinnati companies. The airline served destinations including Baltimore, Boston, Cedar Rapids, Columbus (OH), Green Bay, Greensboro, Greenville, Hartford, Memphis, Milwaukee, New York\\u2013JFK, and Wilmington (NC).\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nThe airline also became the first international feed carrier by feeding the\\nBritish Airways\\nConcorde\\nat JFK. In 1991, the airline ceased operations because of high fuel prices and the suspension of the British Airways contract after the first Gulf War.\\nDelta Air Lines hub\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDelta Air Lines\\nBoeing 767-300ER\\nheading to Paris\\nIn the mid-1980s, Delta opened a hub in Cincinnati and constructed Terminals C and D with 22 gates. During the decade, Delta ramped up both mainline and Comair operations and established\\nDelta Connection\\n.  Delta's continued growth at CVG then prompted them to spend $550 million to build their own terminal facility in the 1990s.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nThe new terminal, known then as Terminal 3, opened in 1994 and would largely replace Terminal D. Terminal 3 consisted of three airside concourses, with most of Terminal D's gate space being repurposed into Terminal 3's Concourse A while Concourses B and C were new construction. Concourses A and B were parallel concourses connected to Terminal 3's main building by an underground walkway which also included\\na people mover\\n(a similar layout to Delta's main hub at\\nHartsfield\\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport\\n). Concourse C was only accessible by shuttle buses and was a ground-level facility for regional aircraft used by\\nDelta Connection\\n(operated by\\nComair\\n). After the opening of Terminal 3, the former Terminals B and C were renamed Terminals 1 and 2 respectively, which continued to house non-Delta airlines.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nAircraft operations dramatically increased from around 300,000 to 500,000 yearly aircraft movements. In turn, passenger volumes doubled within a decade from 10 million to over 20 million. This expansion prompted the building of runway 18L/36R and the airport began making preparations to construct Concourse D while adding an expansion to Concourse A and B.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nAt its peak, CVG became Delta's second largest hub, handling over 600 flights daily in 2005.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nIt was the fourth largest hub in the world for a single airline, based on departures, ranking only behind Atlanta, Chicago\\u2013O'Hare, and Dallas/Fort Worth.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nThe hub served everything from a 64-mile flight to Dayton, to a daily nonstop to Honolulu and Anchorage, to transatlantic destinations including Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Manchester, Munich, Paris, Rome, and Z\\u00fcrich.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAdditionally,\\nAir France\\noperated flights into CVG for several periods for over a decade before finally terminating the service in 2007.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nWhen Delta went into bankruptcy in September 2005, a large reduction at CVG eliminated most early-morning and night flights.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nThese initial cuts caused additional routes to become unprofitable, causing the frequency of low-volume routes to be further cut from 2006 to 2007. Planning for the new east\\u2013west runway stopped, along with all expansions to current terminals; Terminal 1 was closed due to lack of service.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nIn 2008, Delta merged with\\nNorthwest Airlines\\nand cut flight capacity from the Cincinnati hub by 22 percent with an additional 17 percent reduction in 2009.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nConcourse C, which had opened in 1994 at a cost of $50 million, was permanently closed in 2008 and demolished in 2016, since it was built for smaller regional jets which were going out of fashion, and it was not connected to the people mover system.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nFurther reductions in early 2010 caused Delta to close Concourse A in Terminal 3 on May 1, consolidating all operations into Concourse B. This resulted in the layoff of more than 800 employees.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nBy 2011, Delta was down to roughly 130 flights per day at CVG.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nAfter several years of cuts to its older fleet, which were cited as being cut due to high costs associated with rising oil prices, Delta's wholly owned and CVG-based subsidiary,\\nComair\\n, ceased all operations in September 2012, ending over three decades of operations.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nIn 2017, the hub was downgraded to a focus city, which was eliminated in 2021.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nRecent history\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nConcourse B ramp tower\\nUntil 2015, CVG consistently ranked among the most expensive major airports in the United States.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nDelta operated over 75% of flights at CVG, a fact often cited as a reason for relatively high domestic ticket prices.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nAirline officials suggested that Delta was practicing\\npredatory pricing\\nto drive away discount airlines.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nFrom 1990 to 2003, ten discount airlines began service at CVG, but later pulled out,\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nincluding\\nVanguard Airlines\\n, which pulled out of CVG twice.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nAfter\\nDelta\\ndownsized its hub operations, low cost carriers began operations and have been sustained at the airport ever since.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nTerminal 2 was closed in May 2012, and CVG re-opened and consolidated all non-Delta airlines to Concourse A in Terminal 3 at that time, which became the sole terminal.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nRenovation and expansion of the ticketing/check-in area and Concourse A took place that year to accommodate the move.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nTerminals 1 and 2 were torn down in early 2017 to construct an overnight parking and deicing area.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nBoth concourses, the customs facility, baggage claim, and ticketing areas were renovated in late 2017 to mid 2018 under a $4.5 million plan.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nIn 2021, the airport opened a new rental car and ground transportation center adjacent to the main terminal.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nFacilities\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTerminal\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nUnderground walkway leading to Concourses A and B\\nThe airport has one terminal and two concourses with a total of 51 gates.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nBoth concourses are islands and are only accessible by an underground moving walkway and\\npeople mover\\n.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nAll international arrivals without pre-clearance are handled in Concourse B.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nConcourse A\\nhas 23 gates.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nConcourse B\\nhas 28 gates.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nInterior view of Concourse B\\nArt\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain article:\\nWinold Reiss industrial murals\\nA\\nMastodon\\nfossil at Concourse B\\nThe current airport is home to 5 of 16 large\\nArt Deco\\nmurals created for the train concourse building at\\nCincinnati Union Terminal\\nduring the station's construction in 1932. Mosaic murals depicting people at work in local Cincinnati workplaces were incorporated into the interior design of the railroad station by\\nWinold Reiss\\n, a German-born artist with a reputation in interior design. When the train concourse building was designated for demolition in 1972, a \\\"Save the Terminal Committee\\\" raised funds to remove and transport 14 of the murals in the concourse to new locations in the Airport. They were placed in Terminal 1, as well as Terminals 2 and 3, which were then being constructed as part of major airport expansion and renovation. When Terminals 1 and 2 were demolished, the murals in those areas were stored and the new Security Screening building was designed to accommodate the heavy weight of the murals with the eastern \\\"store front\\\" windows designed to be removable to permit the future installation of the murals. The murals were also featured in a scene in the film\\nRain Man\\nstarring\\nDustin Hoffman\\nand\\nTom Cruise\\n. In addition, a walkway to one of the terminals at CVG was featured in the scene in the film when Hoffman's character, Raymond,\\nrefused to fly\\non a plane. The nine murals located in the former Terminals 1 & 2 were relocated to the\\nDuke Energy Convention Center\\nin downtown Cincinnati, while five murals remain in Terminal 3 to this day.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nAdditionally, there are several pieces of\\nCharley Harper\\nartwork in the Concourse B food court.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nCargo hubs\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nA DHL\\nBoeing 767-200\\n(N784AX) taxiing at CVG\\nIn 1984, DHL opened its CVG hub and began operations throughout the world. For a five-year period beginning in 2004, DHL moved its hub to\\nWilmington Air Park\\nin Wilmington, Ohio. In 2009, DHL reversed course and moved back to CVG to resume its original operations. CVG now serves as the largest of DHL's three global hubs (the other two being\\nLeipzig/Halle\\nand\\nHong Kong\\n) with numerous flights each day to destinations across North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific.\\n[\\ncitation needed\\n]\\nDHL has completed a $105 million expansion and employs approximately 2,500 at CVG.

The money was used to double the gate capacity for transferring cargo, an expansion to the sorting facility, and various technical improvements, which was completed in Autumn 2016. In addition, this has provided many more jobs for the Cincinnati area, and will dramatically increase the airport's operations.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nOn January 31, 2017,\\nAmazon\\nannounced that its new cargo airline,\\nAmazon Air\\nwould pick CVG as its main worldwide shipping hub, following an investment of $1.49B in the construction and expansion of a cargo facility on the airport grounds.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nThe company used\\nDHL\\n's facilities prior to the construction of its new facility.

The\\naverage billionaire is 66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a\\nselect few have gotten super-rich super young.\\n\\nThis year, the 25 youngest people on the _Forbes_ \\u2019 [World\\u2019s Billionaires\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\\") are all 33 or younger. Together they\\nare worth $110 billion. A few are self-made, having built notable companies\\nlike Snap (Evan Spiegel, 33), Gymshark (Ben Francis, 31) and Oculus VR (Palmer\\nLuckey, 31).\\n\\nMost had a lot of help. For the first time since 2009, every billionaire under\\n30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs\\naging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\n\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years\\nold and still in college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her\\nminority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late\\ngrandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are\\ntwo of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18\\nheirs among this set.\\n\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who\\nare worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based\\nconglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and\\nenergy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of\\ntheir father, Cyrus Mistry, who died less than three months after their\\nrevered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have [joined the\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/\\\") in the past three years due to a father\\u2019s passing. Italy\\u2019s\\nClemente Del Vecchio, 19, received a hefty stake in the Italian-French maker\\nof Ray-Ban, EssilorLuxottica, after the 2022 death of Leonardo Del Vecchio.\\nHis brothers Leonardo Maria, 28, and Luca, 22, also inherited fortunes, as did\\nthree older siblings. Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress\\nto Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann,\\nwho died in January at age 84.\\n\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational\\nwealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the United\\nStates, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold\\n$95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal\\nReserve. Trillions are expected to change hands every year as the affluent\\nelderly pass away and leave their fortunes to descendants. Aging billionaires\\nlike Charles Koch, 88, and Phil Knight, 86, are currently [preparing to pass\\ntheir inheritances](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2023/10/10/how-\\nfour-aging-billionaires-are-making-sure-their-money-doesnt-go-to-uncle-\\nsam/?sh=74cdd8e242cd \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2023/10/10/how-\\nfour-aging-billionaires-are-making-sure-their-money-doesnt-go-to-uncle-\\nsam/?sh=74cdd8e242cd\\\") on to their children.\\n\\nAnother reason so many super-young billionaires are heirs: Many of the\\narchetypal self-made young moguls, such as Snap\\u2019s Bobby Murphy (35) and Meta\\u2019s\\nMark Zuckerberg (39, United States), have grown up. They aren\\u2019t being\\nreplaced. This year, there\\u2019s just one self-made newcomer among the 25\\nyoungest: Japan\\u2019s Shunsaku Sagami, 33, a merger and acquisitions dealmaker\\nwhose company M&A Research Institute Holdings uses AI to match clients. Its\\nstock has spiked over 800% since it went public in June 2022, sending him\\n[soaring into the billionaire\\nranks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/04/28/super-active-32-year-\\nold-dealmaker-is-japans-newest-billionaire/?sh=734009034334\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/04/28/super-active-32-year-old-\\ndealmaker-is-japans-newest-billionaire/?sh=734009034334\\\"). And making fortunes\\nyoung is no guarantee that entrepreneurs can hold onto them. Ryan Breslow was\\nthe youngest self-made billionaire last year at 28. [If he hadn\\u2019t blown\\nit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/03/11/the-billion-dollar-\\nunraveling-of-ryan-breslow/?sh=39d0f2ea547e\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/03/11/the-billion-dollar-\\nunraveling-of-ryan-breslow/?sh=39d0f2ea547e\\\"), he still would be.\\n\\nNearly all of these 25 who made the ranks are richer than last year. The\\nbiggest year-over-year gain belongs to Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz, whose\\nfortune is up by $4.9 billion, followed by Michal Strnad, who inherited and\\nnow runs the defense producer Czechoslovak Group and is worth $2.4 billion\\nmore than last year.
