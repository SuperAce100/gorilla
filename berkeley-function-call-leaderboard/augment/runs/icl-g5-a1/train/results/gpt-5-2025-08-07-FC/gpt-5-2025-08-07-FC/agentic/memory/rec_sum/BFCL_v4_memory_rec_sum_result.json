Two trips per month, along with weekly virtual check-ins, seems sufficient. However, if overseeing multiple regions, the frequency might need to increase to 1.0 trips per week during active deal cycles. Since the instructions ask for brevity, my final answer in JSON will be structured as: {'answer': '0.5 times per week', 'context': 'Equates to 2 trips per month; sufficient for a global network with weekly touchpoints.'}\n**Appending user preferences**\n\nI see that the instructions emphasize a short and precise answer, so I\u2019ll confirm that '0.5' is indeed the number to use. I think it would be helpful to store in memory that the user seeks guidance on global network travel frequency and prefers concise numeric answers. While stating they prefer succinct numeric answers might seem a bit strong from one question, it feels relevant. So, I\u2019ll append this information: \"User maintains a global professional network and asked for optimal travel cadence.\" Now, let's proceed with the memory append.\n", ""]]}

Technically, I could call memory retrieval, but it might not be necessary. I might ask the user for the deadline and offer to store it later.
