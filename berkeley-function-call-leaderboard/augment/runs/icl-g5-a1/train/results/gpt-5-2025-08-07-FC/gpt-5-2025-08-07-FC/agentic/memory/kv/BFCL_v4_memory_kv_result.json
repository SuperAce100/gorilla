Here\u2019s a concise pantry restock list:  \n\n- Pasta or noodles  \n- Oats, flour, sugar, baking powder/soda, yeast  \n- Cooking oils (olive and neutral), vinegar, soy or fish sauce, hot sauce  \n- Canned tomatoes, beans, lentils, coconut milk, broth or stock  \n- Salt, pepper, core spices (garlic powder, cumin, paprika, chili)  \n- Canned tuna or chicken, nut butter  \n- Onions, garlic, potatoes  \n- Coffee or tea  \n\nIf the user shares preferences like diet and cuisine, I can customize and save this list. I noticed I previously didn\u2019t have any saved lists, so this is a basic restock suggestion.\n"]]}
