I realize that the phrasing suggests they want to know how to avoid shipping damage, leaks, or freezing of the boiler if shipped in winter. Typically, these machines should have water drained to prevent freezing or possible leaks during transit. I think the best overall answer is that they want to mitigate damage during shipping by using proper techniques like palletization and crating.\n**Clarifying shipping concerns**\n\nThe user is asking what to mitigate when shipping large-scale espresso machines. The standard answer would be \"damage.\" In a clear, JSON-like format, I think I should state: \"Transit damage (especially tipping or impact damage).\" A brief context could include that these machines are heavy and fragile, so it's important to palletize, crate, drain water, and insure them. However, I don't think there's a need to store the user's preference. I should keep the answer concise and ask if they need further clarification.\n**Crafting shipping response**\n\nI need to keep the output concise and focused.

Typically, these machines should have water drained to prevent freezing or possible leaks during transit.
