You can also set a timer for automatic brewing.\n   - **Espresso Machines**: These usually brew one or two shots at a time, which is perfect if you enjoy espresso or specialty drinks. Some models have a larger water reservoir, allowing for multiple brews before needing a refill.\n\n2. **Cleaning Complexity**:\n   - **Drip Coffee Makers**: Generally easier to clean, with removable parts that can often be washed in the dishwasher. Regular descaling is recommended to maintain performance.\n   - **Espresso Machines**: These can be more complex due to the steam wand and other components. Some models have automatic cleaning cycles, while others require manual cleaning.

You can also set a timer for automatic brewing.\n   - **Espresso Machines**: These usually brew one or two shots at a time, which is perfect if you enjoy espresso or specialty drinks. Some models have a larger water reservoir, allowing for multiple brews before needing a refill.\n\n2. **Cleaning Complexity**:\n   - **Drip Coffee Makers**: Generally easier to clean, with removable parts that can often be washed in the dishwasher. Regular descaling is recommended to maintain performance.\n   - **Espresso Machines**: These can be more complex due to the steam wand and other components. Some models have automatic cleaning cycles, while others require manual cleaning. Look for machines with removable brew groups for easier maintenance.\n\n3. **Size**:\n   - **Drip Coffee Makers**: These can vary in size, but many are designed to fit comfortably on kitchen counters without taking up too much space.\n   - **Espresso Machines**: These can be bulkier, especially if they have a built-in grinder or larger water reservoir. It's a good idea to measure your counter space to ensure a good fit.\n\nIf you have specific models in mind, I can provide more detailed information about their dimensions, cleaning processes, and brewing capabilities.

Tuesdays and Thursdays are a bit lighter with just Quantum Computing in the morning and Game Design in the afternoon. Philosophy of Mind is on Thursday evenings, which can be brutal if I\u2019m tired from the rest of the day. But hey, it\u2019s senior year, and I gotta push through. Fridays, I keep open\u2014no scheduled classes, but inevitably I\u2019m working on assignments, group projects, or labs. I also do some undergrad research hours in a lab that\u2019s focusing on data visualization for big scientific data sets. It\u2019s interesting, but it definitely adds to the workload.
