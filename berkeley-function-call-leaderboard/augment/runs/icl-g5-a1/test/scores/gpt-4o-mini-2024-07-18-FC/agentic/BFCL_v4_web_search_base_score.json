It is the primary airport serving the\\nInland Northwest\\n, which consists of 30 counties and includes areas such as Spokane, the\\nTri-Cities\\n, both in\\nEastern\\nWashington, and\\nCoeur d'Alene\\nin\\nNorth\\nIdaho\\n. The airport's code, GEG, is derived from its former name, Geiger Field, which honored Major\\nHarold Geiger\\n(1884\\u20131927).\\nAs of 2023, Spokane International Airport (GEG) ranks as the 73rd-busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger enplanements.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nAt 4,264,875 total passengers served in 2024, it is the second busiest airport in Washington. GEG is served by seven airlines with\\nnon-stop\\nservice to more than 20 destinations in the continental US.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nIt is included in the\\nFederal Aviation Administration\\n(FAA)\\nNational Plan of Integrated Airport Systems\\nfor 2017\\u20132021, in which it is\\ncategorized\\nas a small-hub primary commercial service facility.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nExcluding military airfields, general aviation, and cargo airports, GEG Airport, at 6,140 acres (9.6\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi; 24.8\\u00a0km\\n2\\n), is the largest commercial/public airport in all of Washington state in terms of land area.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWorld War II Geiger Field postcard\\nGeiger Field in 1943\\nKnown as\\nSunset Field\\nbefore 1941, it was purchased from the county by the\\nWar Department\\nand renamed\\nGeiger Field\\n(hence the\\nIATA\\ncode\\nGEG\\n) after Major\\nHarold Geiger\\n, an\\nArmy aviation\\npioneer who died in a crash in 1927.\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, Geiger Field was a major training base by\\nSecond Air Force\\nas a group training airfield for\\nB-17 Flying Fortress\\nheavy bombardment units, with new aircraft being obtained from\\nBoeing\\nnear\\nSeattle\\n. It was also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; Deer Park Airport and\\nFelts Field\\nwere auxiliaries.\\nIn 1943, General Hap Arnold established the first formal fire protection training course at Geiger Field, Washington. It was used until 1946.\\nGeiger Field was served by a rail connection to the\\nGreat Northern Railway\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nGeiger was closed in late 1945 and turned over to\\nWar Assets Administration\\n(WAA), then transferred to Spokane County and developed into a commercial airport. The airport hosted USAF\\nAir Defense Command\\ninterceptor\\nunits during the\\nCold War\\nfor air defense of\\nHanford Nuclear Reservation\\nand\\nGrand Coulee Dam\\n. Built in 1942 as the Spokane Air Depot,\\nFairchild Air Force Base\\nis four miles (6\\u00a0km) to the west.\\nIt became Spokane's municipal airport in 1946, replacing\\nFelts Field\\n, and received its present name in 1960, after the City of Spokane was allotted Spokane Geiger Field by the Surplus Property Act and\\nAir Canada\\nstarted service to\\nCalgary\\n.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nIn November 1972, the\\n4702d Defense Wing\\nmoved to the airfield. It was still used by the Air Force into the early 1960s, with the\\n84th Fighter Group\\noperating\\nConvair F-106 Delta Dart\\ninterceptors\\n.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nThe airport code is still GEG, for Geiger Field.\\nConcourse A and B complex originally opened in 1965.\\nThe current Concourse A and B complex opened in 1965, designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nExpansion from the 1970s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nA second level was added to Concourse A and Concourse B in 1974.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nThe airport has a Master Plan,\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nwhich includes a third runway and gates added to Concourse C.\\nA new\\ncontrol tower\\nhas been built south of the airport, replacing the one near Concourse C. The new control tower is the tallest one in the State.  The\\nTerminal\\n,\\nRotunda\\n, and Concourse C Enhancement Project (TRACE) was recently completed, designed by Bernardo/Wills Architects, P.C.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nThe project, which concluded in November 2006, added retail space and expanded security checkpoints in the airport's three concourses, and gave the Rotunda an aesthetic renovation. In 2010, 2000 feet was added to Runway 3\\u201321 and parallel taxiways 'A' and 'G', enabling heavier aircraft departures in summer months.\\nBy 2023, the airport plans to add new gates, centralized security and expanded baggage claim space as it looks to add more direct flights, including to the east coast, to capitalize on and accommodate growing passenger and cargo traffic; the Spokane market has been hosting big events and attracting business to the area.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nTerminal renovation and expansion (TREX) program\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOn October 20, 2022, the airport broke ground on the first phase of the project which includes expansion of Concourse C. The $150 million addition will add 144,000 square feet, 6 new gates and modernization of the existing terminal.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe first portion of the expanded concourse, which includes three gates at the west end, opened in June 2024. The remainder of the project is planned to begin construction in late 2024 and be completed the following year.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nThe second phase of the TREX program is focused on creating a centralized TSA screening checkpoint and baggage claim, as well as an improved operations center. This central connection will also allow easier navigation between the A/B and C concourses.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nAs of January 2023, the 145,000 square foot Central Hall is estimated to cost $179 million and has a planned construction timeline of 2025 to 2027.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nOther projects planned in the TREX program include relocation of the rental car facilities, and renovation of the A/B concourse.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe airport received $6.5 million from the\\n2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\\nto help fund the project.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nFacilities\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAirfield\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe airport covers 6,140 acres (2,480\\u00a0ha) and operates two paved runways:\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nRunway 3/21: 11,002\\u00a0ft \\u00d7\\u00a0150\\u00a0ft (3,353\\u00a0m \\u00d7\\u00a046\\u00a0m), asphalt/concrete\\nRunway 8/26: 8,199\\u00a0ft \\u00d7\\u00a0150\\u00a0ft (2,499\\u00a0m \\u00d7\\u00a046\\u00a0m), asphalt\\nTower\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIt is believed that the tower is the only federally-run air traffic control tower named for any single person. That honor was bestowed in 2010 on Ray Daves, the\\nWorld War II\\nradioman\\nwho survived\\nPearl Harbor\\nand\\nMidway\\nand went on to serve as an air traffic controller in Spokane after the war until the 1970s.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nTerminals\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTerminals at Spokane International Airport\\nThe passenger terminal facility at Spokane International Airport has three main structures; Concourse A and B in the center, Concourse C to the southwest, and the Ground Transportation Center to the north. The three structures are immediately adjacent and connected, however the two concourse structures are not linked with an airside connector on the\\nsterile\\nside; as such, connecting passengers need to transit between Concourse A-B and Concourse C through the landside, non-sterile circulation.\\nConcourse A/B\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nEntrance to the Concourse A-B ticketing area\\nView of the Rotunda in Concourse A-B\\nThe 1965 Concourse A/B complex includes the two concourses linked by a central rotunda area with dining and shopping vendors. The 37,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft (3,400\\u00a0m\\n2\\n) rotunda is supported entirely along its perimeter and features no obstructions.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nConcourse A houses 5 gates (11-15), while Concourse B houses 8 gates (1\\u20138).\\nThe Concourse A-B complex originally opened on April 1, 1965, and was designed by Warren C. Heylman and William Trogdon.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nThe new terminal cost a reported\\nUS$4,600,000\\n(equivalent to $45,900,000 in 2024) and was dedicated on May 8, 1965,\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nin a ceremony attended by Senator\\nWarren Magnuson\\nand\\nCivil Aeronautics Board\\nchair\\nAlan Boyd\\n.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nDesigned in the Neo-Expressionism style, the building's architecture prominently features exposed concrete as well as distinct sculpted and monolithic architectural shapes and forms.\\nAs the airport has continued to incrementally expand, some of the original architectural intent of the Concourse A-B complex has been lost. While several expansions to the concourse extended the building's original architectural style, other additions have altered it. In 1974, a second floor was added to both Concourses A and B to allow for the implementation of\\npassenger boarding bridge\\naccess to aircraft. The new floors, while sharing some material commonality with the original Heylman and Trogdon concourse, lacked the same curvy and sculpted neo-expressionistic forms. The later additions of the ground transportation facility and Concourse C to the ends of the concourse building further altered the architecture by replacing its distinct bookend elevations and entrances with corridors to the adjacent buildings. Interior renovations in the mid-2000s also replaced many of Concourse A-B complex's original sculpted forms and monolithic materials with more rectilinear forms and contemporary finish materials. Despite this, many of the original architectural elements remain integral to the space (such as the exposed concrete roof trusses and concrete columns), creating a juxtaposition between the newer elements and the original architecture.\\nUnder the proposed Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program to accommodate projected growth, the separate baggage claim areas in Concourse A-B and Concourse C would be consolidated into a single baggage claim with five carousels, and A-B would receive a renovation. Ultimately, operations at A-B would wind down under long-term plans to construct a new terminal in 2030, at the earliest.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nSouthwest Airlines\\nis the current primary occupant operating in and out of Concourse A.\\nDelta\\nand\\nUnited Airlines\\nboth operate in and out of Concourse B.\\nAmerican Airlines\\noperated in and out of Concourse B before relocating to Concourse C in March 2016.\\nConcourse C\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nConcourse C\\nConcourse C houses 9 gates, both upper (30-32) and lower (21a, 21b, 22-26). The lower level gates house regional turboprop aircraft, while the upper-level gates house narrow-body aircraft. The current iteration of Concourse C opened in 2000 after a $20 million redevelopment and expansion project, designed by Bernardo-Wills Architects.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nThe project, which broke ground in 1998 added 80,000 square feet (7,400\\u00a0m\\n2\\n) to the concourse including a new baggage claim and two-story passenger facility. The 11,000-square-foot (1,000\\u00a0m\\n2\\n) concourse was remodeled into service and operations functions.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nThe new Concourse C has a more contemporary architectural style, contrasting the appearance of the Concourse A and B complex, by employing a large use of metal cladding and large curtain window walls on its exterior building envelope. However, it draws inspiration from its neo-expressionist neighbor by architecturally expressing a modular, repetitive, and exposed structural grid through its fa\\u00e7ade and interior lobby areas.\\nAlaska Airlines\\nand its subsidiary carrier\\nHorizon Air\\nwere the primary occupants operating in and out of Concourse C after\\nFrontier Airlines\\nceased operations to Spokane in January 2015.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nHowever, that changed once\\nAmerican Airlines\\nrelocated to Concourse C in March 2016. Alaska and American operate in and out of the upper-level gates, while Horizon operates in and out of the lower level gates.\\nIn October 2022, the airport broke ground on Phase 1 of the Terminal Renovation and Expansion (TREX) program which includes expansion of Concourse C.

Two passengers and two crew were aboard, and all survived with minor injuries. The pilot walked from the crash site to a nearby service station to report it.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nThe crash site was about 200 yards (180\\u00a0m) from the\\nMedical Lake\\nexit (#272) of\\nInterstate 90\\nand the landing gear of the plane was extended.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nDue to fog, the flight had stopped in Pasco rather than Walla Walla.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nOn January 20, 1981, a Beechcraft Model 99A, Cascade Airways Flight 201, crashed into a hill 4.5 miles (7\\u00a0km) from the runway. The accident was caused by an incorrect distance measuring equipment frequency and premature descent to minimum descent altitude. Of the nine on board, seven were killed (including both pilots), and the surviving two passengers were seriously injured. The airline ceased operations about five years later.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nOn March 18, 1994, a\\nDouglas DC-3\\nC of Salair crashed shortly after take-off on a cargo flight to\\nPortland\\n, killing both pilots. The starboard engine failed shortly after take-off; it had previously been in long-term storage and had been overhauled the previous year and fitted to the aircraft on February 21, replacing an engine that developed a misfire and loss of power. It had accumulated 15 hours flight time at the time of the accident. The aircraft was destroyed in the subsequent fire.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\n[\\n59\\n]\\n[\\n60\\n]\\n[\\n61\\n]\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nOn January 4, 1996, a\\nConvair CV-440\\n, operated by Salair on a positioning flight, lost power in both engines at 500 feet on an ILS approach to runway 3 due to fuel starvation and false fuel readings and darkness. The plane performed a forced landing, struck a berm in a field and was substantially damaged. Both occupants survived, but the aircraft was written off.\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of airports in Washington\\nWashington World War II Army Airfields\\nWestern Air Defense Force\\n(Air Defense Command)\\n9th Air Division\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThis article incorporates\\npublic domain material\\nfrom the\\nAir Force Historical Research Agency\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nFAA Airport Form 5010 for GEG\\nPDF\\n, effective February 20, 2025.\\n^\\n\\\"Spokane Intl Airport Data for 2024\\\"\\n(PDF)\\n.\\nbusiness.spokaneairports.net\\n.

He was born to\\nFred\\n, a real-estate developer, and\\nMary Anne MacLeod Trump\\n, a Scottish immigrant. Trump was raised in a strict household and developed a rebellious personality early in his youth.\\nTrump enrolled at the\\nKew-Forest School\\n, a private school affiliated with Fred, when he was five. He developed an aptitude for a variety of sports, particularly baseball. In his seventh grade year, Fred discovered that Trump had secretly been going to\\nManhattan\\n, where he accrued a selection of knives. Fred sent Trump to\\nNew York Military Academy\\n, where he became a corporal his sophomore year and a supply sergeant the following year. After a physical altercation involving one of Trump's subordinates and amid broader hazing controversies at the academy, Trump was relieved of his position and reassigned as a battalion training officer. He graduated from New York Military Academy in May 1964.\\nAfter graduating from the academy, Trump attended\\nFordham University\\n, a\\nRoman Catholic\\nuniversity, allowing him to defer the\\nVietnam War draft\\n; a podiatrist, who was a tenant of Fred's, discovered bone spurs in Trump's heels, allowing him to participate in sports but exempt him from being drafted. Early in his sophomore year, seeking a larger business network, Trump transferred to the\\nWharton School\\nat the\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\n, an institution favored by his father. He did not participate in extracurriculars after his freshman year.

According to younger associates of the Trumps, offenders would face punishments ranging from groundings to spankings with a wooden spoon.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nEarly schooling\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTrump playing baseball in 1962\\nTrump began attending the Carousel Pre-School, a nascent nursery in Jamaica Estates, when he was three.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nHe developed an interest in toy construction equipment and blocks\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nand was tenaciously rebellious;\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nTrump and his mother\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nlater described an instance in which he took Robert's blocks to finish a large structure he was constructing and glued them together, preventing Robert from using his blocks.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nTrump enrolled at the\\nKew-Forest School\\n, a private school in\\nForest Hills, Queens\\n, when he was five.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nFred was on Kew-Forest's board and had donated materials to construct an additional wing of the school.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nKew-Forest, in contrast to the looser Carousel, was traditional and structured, enforcing a dress code.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nAt Kew-Forest, Trump was disruptive and determined to cause mischief, regardless of consequence.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nIn second grade, he purportedly gave his music teacher a black eye,\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nbelieving that, in his telling, the teacher was clueless about music.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nIn interviews conducted for\\nTrump Revealed\\n(2017), a close friend of Trump, Peter Brant, could not recall the incident occurring or Trump mentioning that it had happened.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nDetentions at Kew-Forest became known as \\\"Donny Trumps\\\" for Trump's notorious behavior.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nIn an effort to prevent Trump from causing further mischief, Maryanne, a devout Christian, sent Trump to confirmation classes at\\nFirst Presbyterian Church in Jamaica\\n.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nTrump's behavior remained consistent at Sunday school and home, where he occasionally rebuffed his father.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nThough Trump's grades suffered, he was adept at a variety of sports, including punchball, basketball, football, and soccer.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nTrump was particularly passionate about baseball, playing the position of\\ncatcher\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nand\\nfirst baseman\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand admired the catchers\\nYogi Berra\\nof the\\nNew York Yankees\\nand\\nRoy Campanella\\nof the\\nBrooklyn Dodgers\\n. On several occasions, he secretly brought a transistor radio into class and listened to baseball with earplugs.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nTrump had a paper route and rounded up bottles for deposits. With Brant, he would take the\\nNew York City Subway\\nto\\nManhattan\\nto purchase gag gifts\\u2014such as smoke bombs, and later switchblades\\u2014to play a game that involved throwing knives at a target.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nTheir fascination in the blades developed after the premiere of\\nWest Side Story\\n, a musical featuring street fighting,\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nin 1957, when they were eleven.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nMilitary school\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nNear the end of Trump's seventh grade year, his father, Fred, discovered his cache of knives and learned of his escapes to Manhattan.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nThe revelations infuriated Fred, who decided to send Trump to\\nNew York Military Academy\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nin\\nCornwall-on-Hudson, New York\\n.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nPrior to attending the academy, Trump went to Camp Hilltop in\\nHancock\\n, as his brother,\\nFreddy\\n, had done years earlier.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nHe arrived at New York Military Academy in September 1959, and was advised by Theodore Dobias, a\\nWorld War II\\nveteran.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nDobias physically struck insubordinate cadets and conducted unwilling cage matches between disobedient students twice a week;\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nTrump was subject to physical abuse.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nAdditionally, older cadets often used violence, or threats of violence, to assume authority.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nAccording to Dobias, Trump was reluctant to conform to the expectations of the academy. He quickly excelled at hygiene requirements, sought to compete for contests in order and cleanliness, and worked for higher grades.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nTrump later described his tenure as contingent on \\\"survival\\\".\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nIn interviews, former cadets told\\nGwenda Blair\\nfor\\nThe Trumps\\n(2000) that Trump was socially distant with everyone except for Dobias.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nIn the summers at the academy, Trump would work for Fred at the Swifton Village apartment complex in\\nCincinnati\\n.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nTrump engaged in sports at New York Military Academy, playing one year each of varsity football and soccer, and three years of varsity baseball.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nDobias coached Trump in his time on the junior varsity baseball team,\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nand he was informally named as an assistant coach\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nand a co-captain in his senior year.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nTrump had a poor batting average of .056 in his final year, according to box scores.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nDobias later told Blair that Trump was \\\"aggressive but so coachable\\\"; in Trump's telling, he \\\"finessed\\\" Dobias by respecting him without becoming overcome with fear.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nTrump's decision to quit the football team his junior year, citing an apparently abusive coach,\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nled to criticism from some other students.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nHe was featured in a headline in a local newspaper for helping to secure a win in a baseball game.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nTrump (second from left) in 1964\\nIn four out of the five years Trump attended New York Military Academy, he made its honor roll, requiring a grade average of eighty-five, though he was not in the highest ten percent of his class; Trump had a grade average of eighty his sophomore year. Additionally, he earned a class geometry medal for a perfect score.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nTrump, who started alongside other cadets as a private, became a corporal his sophomore year and a supply sergeant in Company E the following year. As a supply sergeant, Trump ordered a cadet to be struck with a broomstick for breaking formation. In another instance, Trump discovered in an inspection that a cadet, Ted Levine, had not made his bed. Trump took Levine's sheets and threw them on the floor; in response, Levine threw a combat boot at Trump and hit him. Trump then grabbed Levine and attempted to throw him out of a second-floor window, according to Levine.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nIn Trump's senior year, he was promoted to captain of A Company. One month into Trump's tenure, a sergeant he commanded shoved a cadet into a wall for not reacting quickly enough. Amid other hazing controversies at New York Military Academy, Trump was relieved of his position and reassigned as a battalion training officer.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nAs a senior, Trump was appointed to lead a special drill team for the\\nColumbus Day Parade\\non\\nFifth Avenue\\n.\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nAdditionally, he became known for bringing women that cadets viewed as beautiful to the academy;\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nTrump's senior year yearbook identified him as class \\\"ladies' man\\\".\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nBy that year, Trump had become determined that he would assume control of Fred's business,\\nthe Fred Trump Organization\\n.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nHe graduated from New York Military Academy in May 1964\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nwith a B average;\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nTrump's specific grades remained sealed after\\nMichael Cohen\\n, later his personal lawyer, told his high school, his colleges, and the\\nCollege Board\\nnot to release his grades or\\nSAT\\nscores.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFor his senior year portrait, Trump took medals from another cadet who was expelled for fighting another student who antisemitically disparaged his father. At the academy's graduation ceremony the following month, Trump received only one distinction: an honorary saber for serving as a captain.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nAs the\\nVietnam War\\nintensified,\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nTrump was able to defer\\nthe draft\\nby choosing to attend college.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nCollege\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFordham University\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAfter graduating from New York Military Academy, Trump considered attending the\\nUniversity of Southern California\\nto study film,\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nbut chose to enroll at\\nFordham University\\n, a\\nRoman Catholic\\nuniversity in\\nthe Bronx\\n, owing to its proximity to his parents's home.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nHis decision disappointed his father, Fred, who preferred that Trump attend the\\nWharton School\\nof the\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\n, an institution that Trump's brother,\\nFreddy\\n, likewise rejected. Trump's sister,\\nMaryanne\\n, privately said that she had helped get him into Fordham.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nTrump commuted from Jamaica Estates to Fordham's campus. As a freshman, Trump's wealth and military background gave him distance from the school's culture; he additionally abstained from smoking and drinking, in contrast to many of the students at Fordham. He joined the school's squash team that year and sought to integrate himself into the culture.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nTrump was recruited for the school's Division III football club as a punter, but quit approximately three or four weeks later after he injured his ankle. He also participated in Fordham's tennis team.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nTrump worked on his father's eponymous\\nTrump Village\\nduring school breaks.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nTrump did not take notes in class or review notes from a study partner, but was able to learn the material verbally. He participated in Fordham's\\nReserve Officers' Training Corps\\nprogram, but withdrew his sophomore year as the Vietnam War escalated; cadets commit to being assigned as commissioned officers, assuring that they would be given a tour of duty in\\nVietnam\\n. At universities, professors, wary of sending young men to war, often elevated their grades ensure that they would meet the threshold. Trump was pressured to do well in his classes, though he did not make the dean's list his freshman year.\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nEarly in Trump's sophomore year, he told an alumnus of New York Military Academy that he was transferring to the Wharton School to \\\"make better contacts for [his] future.\\\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nFreddy later contacted a high school friend who worked at the University of Pennsylvania's admissions office to admit Trump;\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nthough he met the grade requirement and many students had been accepted to the school, at the time,\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nits prestige appealed to the Trumps.\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nAccording to\\nMichael D'Antonio\\nin\\nNever Enough\\n(2015), Fred was insistent that his son graduate from an\\nIvy League\\ninstitution, despite Trump's desires to forgo formal education.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nTrump was not a member of any club, sports team, or fraternity at the University of Pennsylvania, and he was not photographed for his senior year yearbook.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nHe did not appear in Wharton's honor roll.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nSpeaking to\\nTimothy L. O'Brien\\nfor\\nTrumpNation\\n, Trump stated that his performance at Wharton necessitated that he \\\"break out of that mold\\\".\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nAs\\nopposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War\\nmounted at college campuses, the University of Pennsylvania was largely insulated; though Trump personally opposed the war, he did not participate in\\nprotests\\n.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nTrump graduated from the Wharton School in May 1968 with a\\nBachelor of Science\\nin economics.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nHis graduation made him eligible for the draft after education deferments for attending Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania. Trump's birthday gave him a high lottery number of 356 out of 366, nearly ensuring that he would not be subject to a mandatory draft.\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nYears prior, he had visited a podiatrist who leased office space from Fred, who discovered that Trump had bone spurs in his heels, ensuring that Trump could play sports but not be eligible for the draft. The finding was potentially supported by another podiatrist who was a tenant of a Trump property.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nNotes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\nFred and Mary had three children before Donald:\\nMaryanne\\n(1937\\u20132023),\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nFred Jr.\\n(1938\\u20131981),\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nand Elizabeth (born 1942),\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nand one child afterward:\\nRobert\\n(1948\\u20132020).\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n^\\n85-14 Midland Parkway is referred to as\\nColonial-Georgian\\nby\\nWayne Barrett\\nin\\nTrump\\n(2016),\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nbut its architecture is also described as\\nColonial Revival\\nby\\nMichael D'Antonio\\nin\\nNever Enough\\n(2015)\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nand by\\nSusanne Craig\\nand\\nRuss Buettner\\nin\\nLucky Loser\\n(2024).\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nKranish & Fisher 2017\\n, p.\\u00a030.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nKranish & Fisher 2017\\n, p.\\u00a037.\\n^\\nBlair 2000\\n, p.\\u00a0229.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\ne\\nf\\ng\\nBarrett 2016\\n, p.\\u00a044.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nCraig & Buettner 2024\\n, p.\\u00a026.\\n^\\nRoberts & Haberman 2023\\n.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\nHurt 1993\\n, p.\\u00a075.\\n^\\nBlair 2000\\n, p.\\u00a0320.\\n^\\nKarni 2020\\n.\\n^\\nRozhon 1999\\n.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nO'Brien 2005\\n, p.\\u00a043.\\n^\\nRosin 2018\\n.\\n^\\nCraig & Buettner 2024\\n, p.\\u00a027.\\n^\\nBlair 2000\\n, p.\\u00a0164.\\n^\\n\\\"Lack of Supplies Hampers Builder\\\".

The\\naverage billionaire is 66, and the oldest person in the ranks is 102. Still, a\\nselect few have gotten super-rich super young.\\n\\nThis year, the 25 youngest people on the _Forbes_ \\u2019 [World\\u2019s Billionaires\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\\\") are all 33 or younger. Together they\\nare worth $110 billion. A few are self-made, having built notable companies\\nlike Snap (Evan Spiegel, 33), Gymshark (Ben Francis, 31) and Oculus VR (Palmer\\nLuckey, 31).\\n\\nMost had a lot of help. For the first time since 2009, every billionaire under\\n30 inherited his or her fortune\\u2014the result of some self-made entrepreneurs\\naging into their 30s, and a sign that the \\u201cgreat wealth transfer\\u201d has begun.\\n\\nThe youngest billionaire in the world is Brazil\\u2019s Livia Voigt. Just 19 years\\nold and still in college, she\\u2019s worth an estimated $1.1 billion thanks to her\\nminority stake in the electrical equipment producer WEG, which her late\\ngrandfather cofounded. She and her older sister, Dora Voigt de Assis, 26, are\\ntwo of seven fresh faces among the 25 youngest billionaires, and two of 18\\nheirs among this set.\\n\\nThe wealthiest of the heirs are Ireland\\u2019s Mistry brothers, ages 25 and 27, who\\nare worth an estimated $4.9 billion apiece thanks to the Mumbai-based\\nconglomerate Tata Sons, which spans IT and communications, engineering and\\nenergy. They received their minority stakes in Tata after the 2022 death of\\ntheir father, Cyrus Mistry, who died less than three months after their\\nrevered grandfather Pallonji Mistry.\\n\\nThey\\u2019re far from the only young billionaires to have [joined the\\nlist](https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/segunolakoyenikan/2024/04/02/new-\\nbillionaires-2024-taylor-swift-magic-johnson-and-263-others-join-the-ranks-\\nthis-year/\\\") in the past three years due to a father\\u2019s passing. Italy\\u2019s\\nClemente Del Vecchio, 19, received a hefty stake in the Italian-French maker\\nof Ray-Ban, EssilorLuxottica, after the 2022 death of Leonardo Del Vecchio.\\nHis brothers Leonardo Maria, 28, and Luca, 22, also inherited fortunes, as did\\nthree older siblings. Then there\\u2019s Sophie Luise Fielmann, 29, German heiress\\nto Fielmann AG, an eyeglasses fortune left by her father, G\\u00fcnther Fielmann,\\nwho died in January at age 84.\\n\\nThese inheritances illustrate the beginning of a long-anticipated generational\\nwealth transfer among aging populations around the world. In the United\\nStates, Baby Boomers and their elders (those born in 1964 or earlier) hold\\n$95.9 trillion of a total $147.1 trillion of household wealth, per the Federal\\nReserve. Trillions are expected to change hands every year as the affluent\\nelderly pass away and leave their fortunes to descendants.

For the top tier of Hollywood\\ntalent, acting in a film has become just one element of a multi-year, multi-\\nplatform partnership between a studio and an actor to develop, produce, and\\nmost importantly market a project to audiences.\\n\\nThose who have proven their ability to personally convert fans into customers\\nhave become more valuable than ever before. Johnson\\u2019s contract for _Red One_ ,\\nwhich included up-front fees for acting and producing\\u2014as well as a buyout of\\nback-end participation for both roles\\u2014will pay him an estimated $50 million,\\nbelieved to be the highest fee-plus-buyout total in history for a single\\nmovie.\\n\\nWhen combined with Johnson\\u2019s impressive deal for _Moana 2_ and his catalog of\\nolder titles, he earned an estimated $88 million last year (after paying fees\\nto his agent and lawyer), making him the highest-paid actor of 2024.\\n\\nRight on his heels is Ryan Reynolds, who, similarly, was the lead producer,\\nco-writer and star of the year\\u2019s biggest live-action theatrical hit, _Deadpool\\n& Wolverine_. He even produced commercials for the movie through his marketing\\nagency, Maximum Effort. Reynolds\\u2019 busy year was rewarded with an estimated $85\\nmillion (after fees), though in the end 2024 might be remembered for the\\n[swarm of lawsuits between his wife, Blake Lively, and _It Ends With Us_\\nfilmmaker Justin\\nBaldoni](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/02/21/justin-baldoni-\\nvs-blake-lively-feud-explained-lively-reynolds-say-theyve-received-violent-\\nmessages/ \\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2025/02/21/justin-\\nbaldoni-vs-blake-lively-feud-explained-lively-reynolds-say-theyve-received-\\nviolent-messages/\\\"), which have seen his name littered throughout court\\ndocuments.\\n\\nClose behind Johnson and Reynolds, in third place, is another power\\npromoter\\u2014Kevin Hart, whose unrivaled volume of self-produced movies, TV shows,\\npodcasts and stand-up comedy continues to reinforce his status as the hardest-\\nworking man in show business, and brought in an estimated $81 million.\\n\\nThose three multi-hyphenates earned the same amount as the rest of the top 10\\ncombined, lapping veteran movie stars like Brad Pitt ($32 million), Nicole\\nKidman ($31 million) and [2023\\u2019s highest-paid actor, Adam\\nSandler](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\\") ($26 million)\\u2014none of whom come with\\ntheir own built-in marketing machine.\\n\\nStill, it pays to be an established hitmaker from a previous generation. The\\naverage age of the top 20, who combined for more than $730 million in earnings\\nlast year, is a little over 54 years old. These actors benefit not only from\\nhigh salaries set by the precedent of past hits, they continue to receive\\nsizable checks each year from those old projects, whether it be TV shows\\u2014\\n_Forbes_ estimates Jerry Seinfeld (No. 4 this year) pockets $30 million each\\nyear for creating _Seinfeld\\u2014_ or decades\\u2019 worth of movies. For example, Matt\\nDamon (No. 16) earned an estimated $8 million last year in profit\\nparticipations from his back catalog, which includes the _Bourne_ and\\n_Ocean\\u2019s_ franchises.\\n\\nThat has made it difficult for new stars to enter the top echelon of pay in\\nHollywood. [Last year\\u2019s top\\n20](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattcraig/2024/03/06/highest-paid-\\nactors-2023-adam-sandler-margot-robbie/\\\") doesn\\u2019t include any actors in their\\n20s or 30s (the youngest is Scarlett Johansson, 40, at No. 19), even after a\\nbreakout year for young stars like Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell and Zendaya.\\nTheir fees have jumped for future projects, say representatives around\\nHollywood, and they are among the hardest actors to book right now, but the\\nconsensus is that they will need to continue to prove that the success came as\\na direct result of their billing in order to achieve top earnings in future\\nyears.\\n\\nEven Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, 29, considered by the industry to be best positioned\\nfor mega-stardom, fell well short of this year\\u2019s list because his Oscar-\\nnominated role as Bob Dylan in _A Complete Unknown_ was negotiated years ago,\\nbefore _Wonka_ and _Dune 2_ turned him into a household name.\\n\\nUnlike last year\\u2019s one-two punch of _Barbie_ and _Oppenheimer_ , most of this\\nyear\\u2019s fortunes were made away from the box office. Six of the top 10 highest-\\ngrossing movies of 2024 were animated, an area of the business where actors\\ngenerally don\\u2019t receive high salaries.\\n\\nWith theatrical releases appearing increasingly risky, A-list talent instead\\nflocked to streaming services, where so-called buyout deals are still the\\nnorm, paying talent a premium flat fee. In a competitive situation in which\\nApple, Amazon and Netflix are all vying for the same star-driven package, an\\nactor might receive a total compensation well over the still-standard $20\\nmillion up-front fee for theatrical movies, as was the case with Pitt (No. 6)\\nand George Clooney (No. 7) for _Wolfs_.\\n\\nWhether that trend continues, or whether the industry\\u2019s chants of \\u201csurvive to\\n\\u201825\\u201d are rewarded with a box office renaissance this year, there remains an\\nironclad belief among agents, managers, lawyers and studio executives that\\nmovie stars are always going to be essential to the future of Hollywood.\\n\\nUltimately, even more than the money earned, the annual list of the highest-\\npaid actors represents a measure of the control that talent can wield within\\nthe industry, and how they choose to use it.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/WireImage/Getty Images\\n\\n## **#1.** **Dwayne Johnson**\\n\\n### $88 million ($103 million gross)\\n\\nThe Rock returned to the top of the [highest-paid\\nactors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/08/11/the-highest-paid-\\nactors-of-2020-dwayne-johnson-ryan-reynolds/\\n\\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2020/08/11/the-highest-paid-actors-\\nof-2020-dwayne-johnson-ryan-reynolds/\\\") list after landing what is believed to\\nbe the largest fee-plus-buyout in streaming movie history, an estimated $50\\nmillion to star in Amazon's _Red One_ last year. And when _Moana 2_ pivoted\\nfrom a TV series to a theatrical release, he negotiated for a percentage of\\nthe movie's profits as an executive producer, an unprecedented deal for voice\\nactors in Disney animation.

But EVs still made up a record 8.1% of new-car purchases in the\\nU.S. last year at 1.3 million units moved and sales are continuing to grow.\\n\\nNot a bad year for the all-electric sector, when you look at the numbers.\\nThose numbers come in from [Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue\\nBook](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2024-ev-sales/), which\\ndelivered its long-awaited annual U.S. sales report today.\\n\\n![logo](https://cdn.motor1.com/custom/share/evus_newsletter_widget_logo.svg)\\n\\nGet the best news, reviews, columns, and more delivered straight to your\\ninbox.\\n\\nback\\n\\nSubscribe For more info, read our [Privacy\\nPolicy](https://accounts.motorsportnetwork.com/legal/privacy-policy) & [Terms\\nof Use](https://www.motor1.com/info/terms-of-use/).\\n\\nAs we noted previously, [the fourth quarter of 2024 was an especially strong\\none](https://insideevs.com/news/746165/us-ev-sales-trump-bump-2024/) for\\nelectric sales, driven in part by aggressive end-of-year lease and finance\\ndeals and fears that the new presidential administration could eliminate some\\nor all of the EV tax credits. In the end, electric sales were up 7.3%\\nannually, and that 8% electric market share was also up from 7.8% in 2023. So\\nit was a good year of electric sales for many automakers\\u2014but certainly not all\\nof them, Cox Automotive reports.\\n\\n\\\"The gains in 2024 were also supported by excellent new products, particularly\\nfrom General Motors and Honda Motor Co., which together sold nearly 80,000\\nmore EVs in 2024 than in 2023,\\\" the report said. \\\"Hyundai Motor Group and Ford\\nMotor Company also notably increased EV sales last year.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, \\\"By volume, Tesla sales were estimated to be lower year over year by\\nmore than 37,000 units (roughly the volume GM added). VW and Mercedes-Benz\\nalso posted significantly lower volumes in 2024 compared to 2023,\\\" the report\\nsaid.\\n\\n![Tesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North\\nAmerica](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\nTesla Supercharger Network: Opening Up In North America\\n\\nIndeed, [Tesla has been losing market\\nshare](https://insideevs.com/news/745958/tesla-q4-2024-production-deliveries-\\nsales/) for some time now. Blame increased competition, an aging lineup of\\nvehicles or people being turned off by CEO Elon Musk, or some combination of\\nthose things, but as the EV sector grows the leadership of the company that\\nkicked it all off was bound to shrink sooner or later. Fans [haven't warmed up\\nto the styling](https://insideevs.com/news/715669/2025-eqs-update-mercedes-\\nbenz/) and high costs of Mercedes-Benz's EVs, and Volkswagen took a major hit\\nwith the ID.4 crossover halting sales [for about three\\nmonths](https://insideevs.com/news/746228/vw-id4-stop-sale-ends/).\\n\\nBut even with those tailwinds, Tesla kept its EV sales crown in 2024. Here are\\nCox Automotive's top 10 best-selling electric models in the U.S. last year:\\n\\n  1. Tesla Model Y\\n  2. Tesla Model 3\\n  3. Ford Mustang Mach-E\\n  4. Hyundai Ioniq 5\\n  5. Tesla Cybertruck\\n  6. Ford F-150 Lightning\\n  7. Honda Prologue\\n  8. Chevrolet Equinox\\n  9. Cadillac Lyriq\\n  10. Rivian R1S\\n\\nThere are a few things we can parse from these results, so let's dig in.\\n\\nThe wins from the Model Y and Model 3 aren't terribly surprising, given\\nTesla's still class-leading charging network and the rapid-fire price cuts on\\nthe cars. It's still hard to go wrong with either of them. What's even more\\ninteresting is that the Mustang Mach-E kept its long-held third-place slot;\\nthe Mach-E has received several important updates and new trim levels as of\\nlate, and it remains among the first non-Tesla EVs to be able to use the\\nubiquitous Supercharger network. The Mach-E is also now the top-selling\\nMustang model of any kind.\\n\\n![2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5\\nLimited](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 Limited\\n\\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\\n\\nThe Ioniq 5 had an extremely strong year, leading the charge for Hyundai to\\nbecome the no. 2 U.S. seller of EVs behind Tesla. (Third place went to GM and\\nfourth went to Ford, if you're curious.) With a native Tesla-style NACS plug\\nfrom the factory and U.S. production allowing it to score whatever EV tax\\ncredits survive the Trump administration, it could have an even better year\\nahead.\\n\\nWhile [demand has indeed slowed for the\\nCybertruck](https://insideevs.com/news/747195/tesla-cybertruck-sales-\\ndemand-2024/), it still edged out the F-150 Lightning as America's best-\\nselling electric pickup truck; that's no easy task. Still, the truck remains\\nincredibly polarizing, and the fact that Tesla entered the truck market but\\nstill couldn't eke out a year of sales gains is quite telling.\\n\\nGM clearly had an excellent year of sales, but [the Honda Prologue was the\\nreal surprise there](https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-\\nprologue-2024-sales/); as we have written before, it's proof that people want\\ngood EVs from this Japanese brand. (The intense lease and financing deals\\ncertainly helped as well.)\\n\\n![Rivian R1S Software](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png)\\n\\nRivian R1S\\n\\nPhoto by: InsideEVs\\n\\nFinally, the Rivian R1S keeping its slot in the top 10 was another positive\\nsign for the company, which saw sales rise nearly 4% in 2024 despite a parts\\nissue halting new car production for longer than the automaker surely wanted.\\n\\nBut as CES proved last week with companies all over the world focused on\\nbatteries, software and autonomy, we're likely in for another banner year for\\nthe growth of electrified cars\\u2014and Cox Automotive's analysts agree. \\\"In fact,\\nin the year ahead, one out of every four vehicles sold will likely be\\nelectrified in some way\\u2014a hybrid, plug-in hybrid or pure EV,\\\" the report said.\\n\\\"One thing is for certain: Each year, more electric vehicles with advanced\\nbattery technology are making their way onto America\\u2019s roads.\\\"\\n\\n_Contact the\\nauthor:[patrick.george@insideevs.com](mailto:patrick.george@insideevs.com)_\\n\\nMore EV Sales News\\n\\n[ ![tesla cybertruck sales demand\\n2024](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Tesla Cybertruck\\nWas A Hit In 2024, But The Hype Is Fading\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747195/tesla-cybertruck-sales-demand-2024/)\\n\\n[ ![bmw 2024 us ev sales\\nrecord](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Nobody\\u2019s Talking\\nAbout BMW\\u2019s U.S. EV Sales Record\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747173/bmw-2024-us-ev-sales-record/)\\n\\n[ ![sony honda afeela dealers\\nces](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Car Dealership\\nModel Is Starting To Crack Like Never Before\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/747005/sony-honda-afeela-dealers-ces/)\\n\\n[ ![plugged in podcast ces\\n2025](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Honda, Sony And\\nChinese EVs: The Big News From CES 2025\\n](https://insideevs.com/features/746815/plugged-in-podcast-ces-2025/)\\n\\n[ ![mercedes ev sales fall\\n2024](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) Mercedes U.S. EV Sales\\nPlummeted In 2024 While PHEVs Surged\\n](https://insideevs.com/news/746611/mercedes-ev-sales-fall-2024/)\\n\\n[ ![honda prologue 2024\\nsales](https://cdn.motor1.com/images/static/16x9-tr.png) The Honda Prologue\\nWas The Surprise EV Hit Of 2024 ](https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-\\nprologue-2024-sales/)\\n\\nWe want your opinion!\\n\\nWhat would you like to see on Insideevs.com?\\n\\n[ Take our 3 minute survey. ](/survey/2025/)\\n\\n\\\\- The InsideEVs team\\n\\nShare this Story\\n\\n  * [ Facebook  ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ X  ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&text=These+Are+The+Top-Selling+U.S.+Electric+Vehicles+Of+2024&via=InsideEVs)\\n  * [ LinkedIn  ](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ Flipboard  ](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&title=These+Are+The+Top-Selling+U.S.+Electric+Vehicles+Of+2024&v=2)\\n  * [ Reddit  ](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ WhatsApp  ](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F)\\n  * [ E-Mail  ](mailto:?body=Hey%2C%20I%20thought%20you%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20see%20this%20article%20on%20InsideEVs.%20Enjoy%21%0A%0AThese%20Are%20The%20Top-Selling%20U.S.%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Of%202024%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F747199%2Fev-top-10-sales-2024%2F&subject=These%20Are%20The%20Top-Selling%20U.S.%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Of%202024)\\n\\nGO TO COMMENTS\\n\\n(\\n\\n)\\n\\nGot a tip for us?
