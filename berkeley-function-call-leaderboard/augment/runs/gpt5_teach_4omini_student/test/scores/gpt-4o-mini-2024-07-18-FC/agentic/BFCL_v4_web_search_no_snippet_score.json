It was introduced in 1982 to a test market and released to the public in April 1984.\\nGeneral Foods\\n, a now defunct company, were the original sellers of the product, but now it is sold by\\nKraft Foods\\n.  It is available in a wide variety of flavors, such  as\\nlemonade\\n,\\nsweet tea\\n, and\\nfruit punch\\n.\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTest marketing and introduction\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCrystal Light was sold in test markets beginning in 1982.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n2\\n]\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nAs of mid-1983, it was being sold in 11 test areas.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nIt was introduced throughout the United States in April 1984.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nGeneral Foods sold $150 million of Crystal Light during the product's first year on national markets, representing 20% of all powdered drink mixes and 2/3 of all sugar-free drink mixes in the United States.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nAdvertisements\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1980s, ads for the product featured\\nLinda Evans\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n(who also featured in print ads for the product),\\nPriscilla Presley\\n,\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand\\nRaquel Welch\\n.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIngredients\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nCrystal Light is sweetened with a combination of\\naspartame\\n,\\nacesulfame potassium\\n,\\nsucralose\\n, and/or sugar depending on the specific product line and flavor.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nFirst packaged in multi-serve canisters, Crystal Light launched single-serve \\\"On The Go\\\" packets in 2004. In 2009, Crystal Light redesigned its multi-serve packaging. On a finished case goods basis, the new design uses 250 tons less packaging than the original.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nIn 2010, Crystal Light launched Pure Fitness, a \\\"naturally-sweetened\\\" low-calorie fitness drink mix\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nwhich is sweetened with sugar and\\nTruvia\\n, a sweetener derived from the\\nstevia\\nplant. It is currently sold in \\\"On The Go\\\" packets.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn 2011, Crystal Light Pure Fitness was renamed Crystal Light Pure, and three additional flavors were introduced.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn April 2012, several Crystal Light varieties were added to the line of sodamix syrups for\\nSodaStream\\nhome soda makers.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nKraft Heinz, the parent company of Crystal Light, offers a product locator on its website to help locate flavors in a desired location. Crystal Light is sold in the U.S. and Canada.\\nCalories per serving have varied throughout the years; non-zero calorie flavors were once as low as 4 calories in 1990 and now, they may be as high as 15 in 2018, depending on flavor.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nHowever, it's not certain if the change is due to the use of new ingredients or if serving sizes have increased.\\nSome Crystal Light products, notably those designated as Crystal Light Energy, also contain an appreciable amount of added caffeine. The company has even experimented with displaying a prominent \\\"with caffeine\\\" tag below the product name on packaging. \\\"Crystal Light products with Energy positioning contain added caffeine,\\\" according to Kraft Heinz. \\\"Crystal Light Energy Wild Strawberry contains 60 mg caffeine per 8 fl oz serving\\\".  In fact, all Crystal Light Energy flavors contain this same amount of caffeine.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nCertain other Crystal Light flavors have long included caffeine as an ingredient. The label of Crystal Light Peach Iced Tea, for instance, says that the flavor contains \\\"25mg caffeine per serving,\\\" or about as much an eight-ounce (240 mL) cup of black tea.\\nProducts\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAll product information is based on information and products offered by Crystal Light's official website, as of January 2019.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nClassics\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBerry Sangria (0 cal)\\nBlack Cherry Lime (0 cal)\\nBlackberry Lemonade (0 cal)\\nBlueberry Raspberry (0 cal)\\nCaribbean Cooler (0 cal)\\nCherry Pomegranate (15 cal)\\nConcord Grape (15 cal)\\nFruit Punch (15 cal)\\nLemonade (15 cal)\\nMango Passionfruit (0 cal)\\nOrange (15 cal)\\nPink Lemonade (15 cal)\\nPomegranate Lemonade (0 cal)\\nRaspberry Ice (15 cal)\\nRaspberry Lemonade (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Kiwi (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Lemonade (0 cal)\\nStrawberry Orange Banana (15 cal)\\nStrawberry Watermelon (15 cal)\\nSweet Tea\\nTropical Coconut (0 cal)\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nPure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGrape (5 cal)\\nLemon (5 cal)\\nLemon Iced Tea (5 cal)\\nMixed Berry Energy (15 cal)\\nPeach Iced Tea (5 cal)\\nRaspberry Lemonade (5 cal)\\nStrawberry Kiwi (5 cal)\\nStrawberry Lemonade Energy (15 cal)\\nTangerine Mango (5 cal)\\nTropical Blend (5 cal)\\nTropical Citrus Energy (15 cal)\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\nLazarus, George (May 7, 1982).\\n\\\"GF, Wyler betting sugar free worth cost\\\"\\n.\\nChicago Tribune\\n. p.\\u00a088.\\n^\\nDean, Susan L.

Sep 2 2025\\n6:38 AM EDT\\nUpdated Tue, Sep 2 2025\\n10:49 AM EDT\\nAmelia Lucas\\n@Thxamelian\\nWATCH LIVE\\nKey Points\\nKraft Heinz will split into two companies.\\nThe deal will reverse much of the $46 billion merger envisioned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital.\\nShares of Kraft Heinz have slid roughly 60% since the merger closed in 2015.\\nIn this article\\nKHC\\nFollow your favorite stocks\\nCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\\nIn this photo illustration, Kraft and Heinz products are shown on March 25, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.\\nGetty Images\\nKraft Heinz\\nwill split into two companies, reversing much of the blockbuster\\n$46 billion merger\\nfrom a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world.\\nThe first of the two new companies, which are not yet named, will primarily include shelf-stable meals and will be home to brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft mac and cheese. Kraft Heinz said that company on its own would have $15.4 billion in 2024 net sales, and approximately 75% of those sales would come from sauces, spreads and seasonings.\\nKraft Heinz said the second new company would be a \\\"scaled portfolio of North America staples\\\" and would include items such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables. That company would have had approximately\\u00a0$10.4 billion\\u00a0in 2024 net sales.\\n\\\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\\\" said\\u00a0Miguel Patricio, executive chair of the\\u00a0board for Kraft Heinz.\\u00a0\\\"By separating into two companies, we can allocate the right level of attention and resources to unlock the potential of each brand to drive better performance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.\\\"\\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.\\nThe deal that created\\nKraft Heinz in 2015\\nwas the brainchild of Warren Buffett's\\nBerkshire Hathaway\\nand private equity firm 3G Capital. While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster began to fade as the combined company's U.S. sales faltered.\\nThen came a\\ndisclosure in February 2019\\nthat Kraft Heinz had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls. The company also slashed its dividend by 36% and took a $15.4 billion write-down on Kraft and Oscar Mayer, two of its biggest brands. Days later,\\nBuffett\\ntold CNBC that\\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway had\\noverpaid\\nfor Kraft.\\nA leadership shake-up and more write-downs of iconic brands, like Maxwell House and Velveeta, followed. Kraft Heinz also began divesting some of its businesses, selling off\\nmost of its cheese unit\\nto French dairy giant Lactalis and its\\nnuts division\\n, including the Planters brand, to\\nHormel\\n.\\nIn recent quarters, the company has invested in boosting some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. Despite turnaround efforts, shares of Kraft Heinz have slid roughly 60% since the merger closed in 2015.\\nCurrent Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera will serve as chief executive of the new grocery staples-focused company after the separation. Kraft Heinz's board has hired an executive search firm to find a CEO for the other company.\\nThe split comes as more big food companies pursue breakups to divest from slower-growth categories and impress investors again.\\nIn August,\\nKeurig Dr Pepper\\nannounced that it will undo the 2018 deal that merged a coffee company with the 7UP owner. Keurig Dr Pepper\\nplans to separate\\nafter it closes its $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee company JDE Peet's. And two years ago, Kellogg\\nspun off\\nits snacks business into Kellanova and renamed itself as WK Kellogg.\\n\\u2014 CNBC's Michele Luhn contributed to this report.\\nDon\\u2019t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\\nTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardest\\nGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-end\\nChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.

For the top tier of Hollywood talent, acting in a film has become just one element of a multi-year, multi-platform partnership between a studio and an actor to develop, produce, and most importantly market a project to audiences.\\nThose who have proven their ability to personally convert fans into customers have become more valuable than ever before. Johnson\\u2019s contract for\\nRed One\\n, which included up-front fees for acting and producing\\u2014as well as a buyout of back-end participation for both roles\\u2014will pay him an estimated $50 million, believed to be the highest fee-plus-buyout total in history for a single movie.\\nWhen combined with Johnson\\u2019s impressive deal for\\nMoana 2\\nand his catalog of older titles, he earned an estimated $88 million last year (after paying fees to his agent and lawyer), making him the highest-paid actor of 2024.\\nRight on his heels is Ryan Reynolds, who, similarly, was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the year\\u2019s biggest live-action theatrical hit,\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n. He even produced commercials for the movie through his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Reynolds\\u2019 busy year was rewarded with an estimated $85 million (after fees), though in the end 2024 might be remembered for the\\nswarm of lawsuits between his wife, Blake Lively, and\\nIt Ends With Us\\nfilmmaker Justin Baldoni\\n, which have seen his name littered throughout court documents.\\nClose behind Johnson and Reynolds, in third place, is another power promoter\\u2014Kevin Hart, whose unrivaled volume of self-produced movies, TV shows, podcasts and stand-up comedy continues to reinforce his status as the hardest-working man in show business, and brought in an estimated $81 million.\\nThose three multi-hyphenates earned the same amount as the rest of the top 10 combined, lapping veteran movie stars like Brad Pitt ($32 million), Nicole Kidman ($31 million) and\\n2023\\u2019s highest-paid actor, Adam Sandler\\n($26 million)\\u2014none of whom come with their own built-in marketing machine.\\nStill, it pays to be an established hitmaker from a previous generation. The average age of the top 20, who combined for more than $730 million in earnings last year, is a little over 54 years old. These actors benefit not only from high salaries set by the precedent of past hits, they continue to receive sizable checks each year from those old projects, whether it be TV shows\\u2014\\nForbes\\nestimates Jerry Seinfeld (No. 4 this year) pockets $30 million each year for creating\\nSeinfeld\\u2014\\nor decades\\u2019 worth of movies. For example, Matt Damon (No. 16) earned an estimated $8 million last year in profit participations from his back catalog, which includes the\\nBourne\\nand\\nOcean\\u2019s\\nfranchises.\\nThat has made it difficult for new stars to enter the top echelon of pay in Hollywood.\\nLast year\\u2019s top 20\\ndoesn\\u2019t include any actors in their 20s or 30s (the youngest is Scarlett Johansson, 40, at No. 19), even after a breakout year for young stars like Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell and Zendaya. Their fees have jumped for future projects, say representatives around Hollywood, and they are among the hardest actors to book right now, but the consensus is that they will need to continue to prove that the success came as a direct result of their billing in order to achieve top earnings in future years.\\nEven Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet, 29, considered by the industry to be best positioned for mega-stardom, fell well short of this year\\u2019s list because his Oscar-nominated role as Bob Dylan in\\nA Complete Unknown\\nwas negotiated years ago, before\\nWonka\\nand\\nDune 2\\nturned him into a household name.\\nUnlike last year\\u2019s one-two punch of\\nBarbie\\nand\\nOppenheimer\\n, most of this year\\u2019s fortunes were made away from the box office. Six of the top 10 highest-grossing movies of 2024 were animated, an area of the business where actors generally don\\u2019t receive high salaries.\\nWith theatrical releases appearing increasingly risky, A-list talent instead flocked to streaming services, where so-called buyout deals are still the norm, paying talent a premium flat fee. In a competitive situation in which Apple, Amazon and Netflix are all vying for the same star-driven package, an actor might receive a total compensation well over the still-standard $20 million up-front fee for theatrical movies, as was the case with Pitt (No. 6) and George Clooney (No. 7) for\\nWolfs\\n.\\nWhether that trend continues, or whether the industry\\u2019s chants of \\u201csurvive to \\u201825\\u201d are rewarded with a box office renaissance this year, there remains an ironclad belief among agents, managers, lawyers and studio executives that movie stars are always going to be essential to the future of Hollywood.\\nUltimately, even more than the money earned, the annual list of the highest-paid actors represents a measure of the control that talent can wield within the industry, and how they choose to use it.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#1.\\nDwayne Johnson\\n$88 million ($103 million gross)\\nThe Rock returned to the top of the\\nhighest-paid actors\\nlist after landing what is believed to be the largest fee-plus-buyout in streaming movie history, an estimated $50 million to star in Amazon's\\nRed One\\nlast year. And when\\nMoana 2\\npivoted from a TV series to a theatrical release, he negotiated for a percentage of the movie's profits as an executive producer, an unprecedented deal for voice actors in Disney animation. After the movie grossed over $1 billion at the box office, Johnson, 52, made what one agent calls \\\"an ungodly amount of money.\\\"\\nTheo Wargo/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#2.\\nRyan Reynolds\\n$85 million ($100 million gross)\\nReynolds was the lead producer, co-writer and star of the biggest live action movie of the year in\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n, which grossed more than $1.3 billion worldwide. But that was only part of a jam-packed year that included starring in John Krasinski's\\nIF\\n, producing a new season of\\nWelcome To Wrexham\\nfor Hulu, and depending on which version of the\\nBlake Lively-Justin Baldoni lawsuits\\nyou believe, reworking the script for his wife's movie\\nIt Ends With Us\\n.\\nAxelle/Bauer/Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#3. Kevin Hart\\n$81 million ($108 million gross)\\nNobody had a more diversified entertainment slate in 2024 than Hart, who starred in a theatrical release (\\nBorderlands\\n), a Netflix film (\\nLift\\n), an Amazon Prime movie (\\nDie Hart 2: Die Harter\\n), a series on The Roku Channel (\\nDie Hart\\nseason three), a series on Peacock (\\nFight Night\\n), the roast of Tom Brady on Netflix, a weekly podcast for SiriusXM (Gold Minds), not to mention 90 stand-up comedy shows. Add in commercial campaigns with DraftKings and Chase\\u2014not counted among his 2024 earnings\\u2014and you basically can't turn on any screen without seeing the 45-year-old comedian.\\nVictoria Will/Invision/AP\\n#\\n4.\\nJerry Seinfeld\\n$60 million ($70 million gross)\\nThe 70-year-old Seinfeld,\\nnamed a billionaire by\\nForbes\\nlast year, remains active on the stand-up circuit while his eponymous sitcom continues to bring in\\neight-figures every\\nyear. During the pandemic, he wrote a script spoofing the invention of Pop-Tarts,\\nUnfrosted\\n, which he eventually directed and starred in for Netflix last year.\\nDimitrios Kambouris/Vogue/Getty Images for The Met Museum\\n#5.\\nHugh Jackman\\n$50 million ($66 million gross)\\nAfter the emotional send-off of his Wolverine character in 2017's\\nLogan\\n, nothing short of a massive payday and the opportunity to work with his good friend Ryan Reynolds would have convinced the 56-year-old Jackman to don the adamantium claws once again. But\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\nwill likely end up being the most lucrative movie of his career.\\nTristan Fewings/Getty Images\\n#6. Brad Pitt\\n$32 million ($42 million gross)\\nAfter pulling\\nWolfs\\n(costarring his good friend George Clooney) from a theatrical release last year\\u2014opting to show it directly on AppleTV+\\u2014 Apple is betting the house on Pitt's 2025 movie\\nF1,\\nin theaters this summer. Meanwhile, his production company, Plan B, continues to be a juggernaut both at the box office (with\\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice)\\nand on the awards circuit (backing longshot Best Picture nominee\\nNickel Boys)\\n.\\nGotham/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#7.\\nGeorge Clooney\\n$31 million ($37 million gross)\\nClooney publicly denied the reporting that he and Brad Pitt were paid $35 million each for the spy comedy\\nWolfs\\n\\u2014which he\\ncalled\\n\\\"bad for our industry if that\\u2019s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries\\u201d\\u2014but Apple had to outbid multiple suitors for the project in 2021. And compared to Clooney's directorial efforts or Pitt's more awards-inclined projects, one dealmaker tells\\nForbes\\nthe movie was \\\"definitely a for-profit endeavor for them.\\\"\\nStefanie Keenan/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#8.\\nNicole Kidman\\n$31 million ($41 million gross)\\nThe reigning queen of AMC Theaters has become one of the most bankable stars in the TV miniseries space, starring in one for Netflix (\\nThe Perfect Couple\\n), one for Paramount+ (\\nLioness\\n), and one for Amazon (\\nExpats\\n) last year, making more than $1 million per episode in each. Add to that two movies featuring romances with much younger men\\u2014\\nBabygirl\\nand\\nA Family Affair\\n\\u2014and the 57-year-old Kidman is the highest-paid actress of 2024.\\nTodd Owyoung/NBC/Getty Images\\n#9.\\nAdam Sandler\\n$26 million ($35 million gross)\\nSandler's overall deal with Netflix is unrivaled in the industry, allowing him to make both big commercial projects like the upcoming\\nHappy Gilmore 2\\nor more modest fare like 2024's\\nSpaceman\\n, and\\nstill receive top dollar\\n. And the back catalog of last year\\u2019s highest-paid actor remains on the platform, racking up hundreds of millions of hours watched each year.\\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\n#10.\\nWill Smith\\n$26 million ($30 million gross)\\nOpinions around Hollywood differ as to whether the 56-year-old Oscar winner is fully \\\"back\\\" after\\nThe Slap Seen \\u2018Round The World\\nin 2022, but all agree that returning to the character that first made him a star was as savvy move. And 2024\\u2019s\\nBad Boys: Ride or Die\\nwas a hit, one of less than 20 movies to gross more than $400 million worldwide last year.\\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images\\n#11.\\nMariska Hargitay\\n$25 million ($29 million gross)\\nAs the anchor for Dick Wolf\\u2019s\\nLaw & Order: SVU\\nfor more than 20 years and 550 episodes, the 61-year-old Hargitay is the highest-paid actor on television by a wide margin. She earns an estimated $750,000 per episode between acting and producing fees, as well as a slice of the show\\u2019s considerable syndication profits.\\nADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images\\n#12.\\nChanning Tatum\\n$24 million ($28 million gross)\\nDespite the box office failure of\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, Tatum\\u2019s earnings were in the stratosphere last year, as his deal was structured with a straight-to-streaming buyout of back-end participation. The 44-year-old Tatum also starred in\\nBlink Twice\\n, directed by his then-girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, and made a long-rumored (yet short-lived)\\ncameo as Gambit\\nin\\nDeadpool & Wolverine\\n.\\nMike Marsland/WireImage/Getty Images\\n#13.\\nJason Statham\\n$24 million ($25 million gross)\\nStatham, 57, has proven to be box office Teflon in recent years, stringing together a series of modest hits playing regular-guy action heroes, including 2024\\u2019s\\nThe Beekeeper\\n. He can command $20 million or more for such roles, in some cases nearly half of the movie\\u2019s production budget, all while operating without the representation of an agent or manager.\\nJordan Strauss/Invision/AP\\n#14.\\nMark Wahlberg\\n$23 million ($31 million gross)\\nWhen Wahlberg isn\\u2019t busy\\nrunning multiple companies\\nand crushing 4 a.m. workouts, the 53-year-old actor divides his efforts on-screen between bigger budget action movies, usually at Netflix, as was the case with last year\\u2019s\\nThe Union\\n, and more personal independent projects like\\nArthur The King\\n.\\nAndreas Rentz/Getty Images\\n#15.\\nMatt Damon\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nArtists Equity, the studio Damon cofounded with his longtime friend and collaborator Ben Affleck, continues to find willing buyers among the streaming services for projects produced by or starring the 54-year-old Oscar winner, including\\nThe Instigators\\nfor AppleTV+ in 2024. In addition to his up-front fees, Damon owns a piece of his movies\\u2019 equity, which sell at a premium price above their production budgets.\\nRebecca Cabage/Invision/AP\\n#16.\\nJohn Cena\\n$23 million ($30 million gross)\\nCurrently on his farewell tour with the WWE, his wrestling home since 2002, the 47-year-old Cena has continued to be a bankable presence in streaming comedies across platforms. In 2024 he starred in\\nArgylle\\nfor Apple,\\nRicky Stanicky\\nfor Hulu, and\\nJackpot!\\nfor Amazon, and made appearances in Kevin Hart\\u2019s\\nDie Hart 2\\nand in one episode of\\nThe Bear.\\nErik Voake/Getty Images for WarnerMedia\\n#17.\\nDenzel Washington\\n$23 million ($27 million gross)\\nA villainous turn in\\nGladiator II\\nnetted another sizable payday, though the 70-year-old Washington will have to do without the laurels of an 11th Oscar nomination, which many Hollywood pundits predicted was coming. He also continues to receive hefty checks from the dozens of hits in his 40-year back catalog.\\nGabriel Olsen/FilmMagic/Getty Images\\n#18.\\nJake Gyllenhaal\\n$22 million ($26 million gross)\\nGyllenhaal\\u2019s 2024 remake of\\nRoad House\\nreportedly\\nfaced a choice\\nbetween a $60 million budget and a theatrical release, or an $85 million budget to go straight to Amazon Prime Video. The latter meant a bigger up-front payday for its 44-year-old star, without the gamble on box office performance. And it wasn\\u2019t the only remake Gyllenhaal fronted last year, as\\nPresumed Innocent\\nbecame a hit series on AppleTV+.\\nCindy Ord/Getty Images\\n#19.\\nScarlett Johansson\\n$21 million ($25 million gross)\\nIn addition to\\nFly Me To The Moon\\n, which she costarred in with Channing Tatum, the 40-year-old actress lent her distinct voice to the lead role in the animated movie\\nTransformers One\\n. It\\u2019s a voice so distinct that Johansson said last May she\\nbelieves it was copied\\nby OpenAI for its chatbot.\\nEmma McIntyre/Getty Images for Academy Museum of Motion Pictures\\n#20.\\nJoaquin Phoenix\\n$19 million ($22 million gross)\\nReprising his Oscar-winning role as The Joker came with the biggest up-front fee of the 50-year-old Phoenix\\u2019s career, even though\\nJoker: Folie \\u00e0 Deux\\nbecame one of the biggest box office bombs of the year.\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nEstimations were calculated through interviews with agents, lawyers, managers, executives and industry experts, as well as data sources such as IMDBPro and Polestar. The figures represent pretax earnings for the calendar year 2024, minus fees for representation \\u2013 10% to agents, 10% to managers and 5% to lawyers, per industry standard, although some actors do not have all three.\\nActors were credited for all compensation on projects in the year they were released, despite the fact that often up front fees are paid when a movie is filmed, which could be years in the past, and back-end participation or buyouts are often paid several years into the future.\\nAdditionally, the ranking only includes earnings related to entertainment\\u2014acting, producing, directing, or other forms of performance (such as stand-up comedy).

Callum Drift, head of\\nSanta Claus\\n's security detail, plans to retire after one last Christmas run, having become disillusioned with people's increasingly toxic behavior, exemplified by the growth of Santa's Naughty List. On\\nChristmas Eve\\n, an unidentified\\nblack ops\\nteam breaks into the\\nNorth Pole\\ncomplex and kidnaps Santa. MORA director Zoe Harlow's subordinates discover that Jack O'Malley, a freelance\\nblack-hat\\nhacker, compromised the Santa Claus's location.\\nZoe apprehends Jack for questioning. Jack, a longtime Santa skeptic, explains that Jack had no idea what the information meant and merely sent it to an anonymous buyer.\\nA mysterious woman kidnapped Santa and keeps Santa in a vault that siphons Santa's magic which knocks Santa unconscious.\\nZoe hires Jack to help find Santa and places a tracker on Jack and Callum reluctantly teams up with him. The mysterious woman and her\\nsons\\nduplicate the\\nGlask\\u00e4fig\\n, planning to imprison all the people who have ever been on the Naughty List.\\nJack and Callum track down Ted, the broker who bought the information, in\\nAruba\\n. Ted reveals that the kidnapper is the winter witch\\nGr\\u00fdla\\n. Gr\\u00fdla becomes aware of Jack, Callum and Ted's conversation from her name being spoken by Jack and sends her\\nsnowman\\nhenchmen to eliminate them. Although Callum and Jack are victorious, Ted is frozen before being questioned.\\nCallum suspects that Gr\\u00fdla is working with\\nKrampus\\n, Santa's estranged adoptive brother, Gr\\u00fdla's ex-lover, and the Naughty List's creator. Callum and Jack break into Krampus' lair but are captured. Callum appeals to Krampus to help Santa Claus, who misses Krampus, but Krampus refuses. Krampus reveals that Gr\\u00fdla came to Krampus to recover the\\nGlask\\u00e4fig\\n, a magical imprisoning\\nsnow globe\\n. Jack steals Callum's magic gauntlet back and returns the magic gauntlet to Callum, allowing the pair to escape.\\nGr\\u00fdla successfully tests the snow globes on Jack and his estranged son Dylan. Jack and Dylan, inside their respective globes, have a heartfelt conversation that, by making them \\\"nicer,\\\" causes the snow globes to break.\\nFollowing the implanted tracker, Zoe and Callum find Jack at the North Pole complex and realize that Gr\\u00fdla and her sons, along with Santa, have been inside the complex the entire time, having caused the search as a diversion. Zoe and Callim also learn that Gr\\u00fdla's team of shapeshifters has taken over the complex. Zoe and Callum find and free the imprisoned Mrs. Claus and other security staff. In Santa's old workshop, Zoe and Callum find Jack, Dylan, and the equipment that Gr\\u00fdla used to mass-produce the\\nGlask\\u00e4figs.\\nGr\\u00fdla prepares to leave with an unconscious Santa, using Santa's sleigh to distribute the\\nGlask\\u00e4figs.\\nA fight ensues, and Gr\\u00fdla is intercepted by Callum and Jack, with assistance from Krampus, who arrives to help. Santa recovers, defeats Gr\\u00fdla with the help of the flying reindeers, and seals Gr\\u00fdla inside a\\nGlask\\u00e4fig.\\nSanta and Krampus acknowledge each other and part ways peacefully. At the same time, Gr\\u00fdla is taken into Zoe's custody.\\nEverybody prepares for the Christmas Eve run. Santa invites Jack and Dylan to accompany him. During the successful run, Callum watches Jack regain his wonder and build a relationship with Dylan. With his faith restored, Callum decides against retiring.\\nCast\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nDwayne Johnson\\nas Callum \\\"Cal\\\" Drift, head of North Pole security for Saint Nicholas\\nChris Evans\\nas Jack O'Malley, a hacker and bounty hunter\\nLucy Liu\\nas Zoe Harlow, the Director of MORA\\nKiernan Shipka\\nas\\nGr\\u00fdla\\n, a Christmas witch who captures Santa Claus\\nBonnie Hunt\\nas\\nMrs. Claus\\n, the wife of Santa Claus\\nKristofer Hivju\\nas\\nKrampus\\n, the brother of Santa and the ex-boyfriend of Gr\\u00fdla\\nNick Kroll\\nas Ted\\nJ.

Skateboarding Cat\\nVroom vroom!\\nBy\\nMaddie Topliff\\nMaddie Topliff\\nMaddie Topliff is the Editor, Pets of Daily Paws and The Spruce Pets.

Maddie is the proud owner of a\\ncockapoo\\nnamed Pickles and\\nAmerican shorthair\\nnamed Jazzy.\\nDaily Paws' Editorial Guidelines\\nPublished on June 13, 2024\\nPhoto:\\n@guinessworldrecords / YouTube Shorts\\nSkateboarding is not only a hobby\\u2014it's a skill\\u2014and not a skill many humans have, let alone cats. But Bao Zi, an\\nAmerican shorthair\\nfrom China, shreds like a pro and just became one of the fastest skateboarding felines in the world and holds the newest Guinness World Record for \\\"Fastest 10 Meters On a Skateboard by a Cat.\\\" He did it in just 12.85 seconds.\\nIn the short video, Bao Zi needs no help from his human and trainer Li Jiangtao to break the record. The one-year-old cat easily mounts the skateboard, propels himself forward, and easily coasts to victory all while his adoring fans look on. Welcome back, Tony Hawk.\\nJiangtao is a very successful trainer and began skateboarding\\nwith his dog\\ninitially. But Bao Zi couldn't let his canine brother have all the glory and eventually mastered skateboarding as well. Bao Zi's skill set isn't limited to the skatepark\\u2014Bao Zi can also perform the following tricks:\\nSitting\\nShaking paws\\nPlaying dead\\nRolling over\\nJumping\\nClimbing\\nGoing through hoops\\nPressing doorbells\\nPushing rolling barrels\\nDribbling a basketball\\nCourtesy of Guinness World Records\\nIf you've ever felt jealous of your friends' talented dogs and their repertoire of tricks, there's no need. Cats, whether or not they have the desire to break a Guinness World Record, can also be quite\\nreceptive to training\\nif they have a patient, understanding owner.\\nYou can train your cat to perform tricks like give a high five, sit, or come\\nin no time\\nwith the right attitude, and of course, the right treats. No skateboard required.\\nTraining your cat is also a great way to\\nbond with your feline\\n, especially if they're a newer member of your household. It's also a great way to mentally stimulate your cat and prevent them from getting bored ...\\nor naughty\\n.\\nWas this page helpful?\\nThanks for your feedback!\\nTell us why!\\nOther\\nSubmit\\nRelated Articles\\nFDA Warns Vets of Serious Complications Linked to Common Dog Arthritis Drug Librela\\nViral TikTok Video Shows Adorable Puppy Named Honey Responding to Being Called Beautiful\\nThese 25 Cities Are Home to the Biggest Cat Lovers in the Country\\u2014Did Your Hometown Make the List?\\nThis Cat Food Brand is Trying to Save the Ocean\\u2014One Coral Reef at a Time\\n150 Cat Names Inspired By Each Taylor Swift Era (Yes, Even The Life of a Showgirl)\\nCat Upstages Owner's Pregnancy Announcement By Defying Gravity in This Viral TikTok Video\\nWatch This Australian Cattle Dog Go Bonkers with Joy When He Finds Out He's Visiting His Grandparents\\nWhy NYC\\u2019s Bodega Cats Are Internet Stars\\u2014and Local Legends\\nMore Related Articles\\nMaine Coon\\nWestminster's 2025 Veterinarian of the Year: A Closer Look at the Winner's Achievements\\nIowa Great Dane Passes Away Just Days After Being Named World's Tallest Dog\\n150 Disney-Inspired Cat Names for Your Adorable New Kitty\\nThe 14 Tallest Dog Breeds\\u2014Who Can Easily Look You In the Eye\\nThis Adorable Chocolate Lab Requires a Kiss on the Nose Before Dinnertime\\nThis Iowa Great Dane Is Officially the World's Tallest Dog\\nAstounding California Border Collies Set a Guinness World Record for Most Dog Tricks\\nDaily Paws\\nNewsletters\\nFollow Us\\nDogs & Puppies\\nCats & Kittens\\nLiving With Pets\\nPet News & Entertainment\\nPet Gear & Apparel\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertise\\nEditorial Guidelines\\nExpert Review Board\\nPrivacy Policy\\nTerms of Service\\nCareers\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nContact Us\\nDaily Paws\\nis part of the\\nPeople Inc.\\npublishing\\u00a0family.\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nNewsletter Sign Up\\nBy clicking \\u201cAccept All Cookies\\u201d, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.\\nCookies Settings\\nAccept All Cookies\"}"}], "step_3": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "{'answer': '1-0', 'context': 'The cat that achieved the fastest 10 m on a skateboard is named Bao Zi, who is one year old as of June 2024.

He was capped 35 times for the\\nJapan national team\\n.

He then achieved a round of 16 appearance at the\\n2022 FIFA World Cup\\nand a quarter-final loss in the\\n2023 AFC Asian Cup\\n.\\nClub career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMoriyasu was educated at and played for Nagasaki Nihon University High School. After finishing his school, he joined\\nJapan Soccer League\\nside\\nMazda\\nin 1987. New manager\\nHans Ooft\\nrated him highly and established him as an anchoring midfielder in the team. In April 1990, Moriyasu had a trial at\\nManchester United\\n. When Japan's first ever professional league,\\nJ.League\\n, started in 1993, Mazda was transformed to\\nSanfrecce Hiroshima\\nfor whom he continued to play. Together with\\nYahiro Kazama\\n, he controlled Hiroshima's midfield and contributed to the club winning the second stage of the 1994 J1 League season.\\nIn 1998, Ooft became the manager of\\nKyoto Purple Sanga\\nand recruited Moriyasu on a loan deal. The deal was initially meant to be a permanent one but infuriated Hiroshima supporters collected signatures against the deal, which forced the clubs to settle for a loan. He was the linchpin of Kyoto for the 1998 season.\\nMoriyasu came back to Hiroshima for the 1999 season but find his opportunities to play gradually decreasing mainly because of young\\nKazuyuki Morisaki\\n's challenge for the place.\\nHe was offered a coaching position at Hiroshima in 2002 but turned it down to continue to play. He moved to\\nVegalta Sendai\\nand retired there at the end of the 2003 season.\\nInternational career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOoft became the national coach of\\nJapan national team\\nin 1992. Ooft called up and played Moriyasu for his first match in charge against\\nArgentina\\nheld on 31 May 1992 at the\\nTokyo National Stadium\\n. Moriyasu was still a low-profile player at that time and many international teammates did not know how to pronounce his name. What Ooft asked him to do throughout his reign was a simple task, to \\\"win the ball and pass it to playmaker\\nRuy Ramos\\n\\\".\\nHe was a member of the Japan team that won the\\n1992 Asian Cup\\nand played all of Japan's games except the final against\\nSaudi Arabia\\nfor which he was ineligible due to suspension.\\nUnder Ooft, Japan progressed to the\\n1994 World Cup qualification\\nfor the\\n1994 World Cup\\n. Moriyasu was on the pitch when Japan's hopes to play in the finals were dashed by an injury-time Iraqi equaliser in the last qualifier, the match that the Japanese fans now refer to as the\\nAgony of Doha\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nHe was capped 35 times between 1992 and 1996.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nHe scored one goal for his country, in a friendly against\\nAustralia\\non 10 February 1996.\\nCoaching career\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMoriyasu coaching Japan at\\n2019 AFC Asian Cup\\nMoriyasu served as a coach for\\nSanfrecce Hiroshima\\nfrom the 2004 season.

The 37-year-old saw a 20-foot birdie putt on the\\n18th hole drop agonizingly low of the hole.\\n\\n\\u201cI enjoyed every minute of it, obviously,\\u201d he said after the round. \\u201c(But I\\u2019m)\\nProbably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62. I knew what was\\nat stake. I just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a good read and\\njust broke away from the hole.\\n\\n\\u201cI went out there with a job to do today, and my job was to try to get myself\\nback in the tournament, and I definitely did that.\\u201d\\n\\n![Shane Lowry celebrates a birdie on the 13th at Valhalla on his way to a\\nrecord-equalling round of 62 at the PGA Championship.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/shane-lowry-celebrates-birdie-\\npga-championship.jpg)\\n\\nThe 2019 Open Champion\\u2019s 62 is the fifth in Major Championship history and\\ncame just two days after [Xander Schauffele became the first man to record two\\nrounds of 62](/news-and-events/majors/us-pga-championship/xander-schauffele-\\nmakes-history-as-first-man-to-record-two-rounds-of-62-in-major-golf-history/)\\nin Majors. Schauffele had previously achieved the feat at Los Angeles Country\\nClub in the 2023 US Open.\\n\\nWhile Branden Grace and Rickie Fowler led the way as the first two men to make\\n62s in Majors, Lowry and Schauffele\\u2019s performances at [Valhalla](/news-and-\\nevents/majors/us-pga-championship/valhalla-golf-club-course-guide/) are\\narguably more impressive due to the course\\u2019s higher par (71). Royal Birkdale,\\nwhere Grace made the first 62 in Major history in 2017, and Los Angeles CC,\\nwhere Fowler made the second (just minutes before Schauffele made the third)\\nboth had pars of 70.\\n\\nLowry, whose previous best score at one of the big four events had been a 63\\non his way to [victory at The Open at Royal Portrush](/news-and-\\nevents/majors/the-open-championship/shane-lowry-open-champion-interview/),\\nreached the turn in 29 having drained putt after putt on a week when he leads\\nall of the stats on the greens. A further three birdies followed as he reached\\nthe final tee in 57 blows knowing he needed to make a four on the par-5 18th\\nto take the record alone.\\n\\n![Shane Lowry grimaces as his putt for a 61 slips by.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/shane-lowry-misses-putt-\\nfor-61.jpg)\\n\\nThe Ryder Cup star found the rough from the tee, forcing him to lay up and\\nrely on his magical short game. He put his approach to 20 feet but held his\\nhead in anguish as the downhill putt turned late in its journey and came to\\nrest just inches to the left of the hole.\\n\\nPlaying alongside [Justin Rose](/equipment/witb/witb-justin-rose/), who shot a\\nseven-under 64, to give himself the chance of becoming the first Englishman to\\nwin the title since Jim Barnes in 1919, Lowry got off to a flying start,\\nmaking birdies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th holes to rocket up the\\nleaderboard.\\n\\nThe run ended at the 6th but he managed two more by the turn, taking advantage\\nof the par-5 7th before holing a 17-footer at the par-4 9th to reach the turn\\nin 29 shots.\\n\\nThe pace slowed on the back nine, but birdies at 13 and 14 briefly saw Lowry\\njump into a share of the lead. He joined the lead again with another red\\nnumber at the par-4 17th before Xander Schauffele again nipped ahead, but\\nLowry will head into Sunday with high hopes of winning his second Major title.\\nIf he does he\\u2019ll become just the fifth European to win the PGA Championship,\\njoining Barnes, Padraig Harrington, Martin Kaymer, and Rory McIlroy.\\n\\n![Shane Lowry is congratulated by Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose after\\nshooting 62 in the PGA Championship at Valhalla.](https://todaysgolfer-\\nimages.bauersecure.com/wp-images/175332/876x584/rose-lowry-handshake-pga-\\nchampionship.jpg)\\n\\nAs well as equalling the record for the lowest Major round, Lowry joins\\nSchauffele as Valhalla\\u2019s course record holder. The previous record \\u2013 a 63 by\\nJose Maria Olazabal in the PGA Championship \\u2013 had stood for 24 years before\\nSchauffele\\u2019s first-round heroics.\\n\\n## Everything Shane Lowry said after his 62\\n\\nAfter his record-equalling round, Shane Lowry joined the media to discuss his\\n62 and hopes of lifting the Wanamaker Trophy for a first time.\\n\\nTHE MODERATOR: Shane Lowry is with us at the 106th PGA Championship. A 62\\ntoday. How would you summarize that performance?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed every minute of\\nit, obviously. Probably the most disappointed anyone can ever be shooting 62.\\nI knew what was at stake. Just didn\\u2019t hit the ball hard enough. Had it on a\\ngood read and just broke away from the hole. Look, I went out there with a job\\nto do today, and my job was to try to get myself back in the tournament, and I\\ndefinitely did that.\\n\\nQ. Best putting round of your career. What do you credit it to?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I don\\u2019t know, to be honest. I changed my putter at the Zurich\\nClassic, and even there like if I had have putted well, I think me and Rory\\nwould have won by a few. I feel like I\\u2019ve sort of changed up how I\\u2019ve been\\npracticing the last two weeks, sort of getting away from the technical side of\\nit and just trying to hole putts and just doing a lot of drills. But yeah,\\nit\\u2019s nice to finally see a few going in the hole because it\\u2019s been a slow year\\nfor me on the greens. It\\u2019s been nice to see it this week. Look, when I got\\nhere, I saw the greens. The greens are beautiful. They\\u2019re a nice pace to hole\\nputts. It was nice to see a few going in.\\n\\nQ. Did you have a number in mind today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I thought if I could get to double digits, that was my plan. If I\\ncould shoot 65, I felt like I\\u2019d be there\\u2013 I\\u2019d obviously need another at least\\n65 tomorrow if I did that. But that\\u2019s what I wanted to do. But obviously a few\\nbetter is nice.\\n\\nQ. It looked like a fried egg on 10 but not the normal kind. Can you walk us\\nthrough that there?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: How disappointing was that? I mean, I was on such \\u2014 you know, I\\nwas on such \\u2014 my momentum was there. I was on a good run, and I hit a great\\nsecond shot straight at the flag. Obviously just come up a few yards short.\\nBut it\\u2019s kind of where I was trying to hit it in that bunker because I knew I\\ncould get it up-and-down, and it pitched in the bunker. Obviously rolled up\\nthe face and rolled back in its pitch mark. It was interesting. And then I\\nfelt like it was just going to come out soft, and it come flying out of it.\\nBut yeah, that was disappointing. But I had a nice up-and-down there, which\\nkept me going.\\n\\nQ. I want to ask you how important is it do you feel now to put yourself in\\nthe position that you\\u2019re now in going into Sunday, and what would potentially\\na second major title mean to you to add to your glittering trophy cabinet?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Obviously you come here the start of every major championship,\\nand you know what it means to win one of theme. I\\u2019ve been fortunate to do it\\nbefore, and to win one is pretty good, but to win multiple, you\\u2019re kind of a\\nbit of a different level. Yeah, it would mean a lot to me tomorrow. Obviously,\\nlook, there\\u2019s a long way between now and that. We\\u2019ll see what Xander does and\\nCollin does on the back nine today first, and then we\\u2019ll go out tomorrow, and\\nhopefully I can -I\\u2019ll just go out and give my best. I go out and fight hard.\\nI\\u2019ve been in this position a few times before, learned from the sort of\\nOakmont and tournaments like that and brought that into Portrush, and\\nhopefully I can bring some of that with me tomorrow and just give it\\neverything.\\n\\nQ. Can you just tell me as someone who will never, ever know what it\\u2019s like to\\nline up a putt for a round of 61, what exactly is going through your mind?\\nWhat are you thinking?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I knew I just really wanted to hole it. Probably too much. Yeah,\\nit was just \\u2014 I kind of stood back and allowed myself to enjoy the moment. It\\nwas a pretty cool moment to have. It would have been a pretty cool moment to\\nkind of seal the deal and do it. But at the end of the day, I knew even if I\\ndidn\\u2019t do it that I done what I needed to do today, and I\\u2019m pretty happy with\\nthat.\\n\\nQ. With what Justin was doing on the front nine, have you ever played so well\\nand not taken the honor on the tee?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I know. I said that to him on the \\u2014 I think it was walking off\\nthe 5th green. I\\u2019m like, What am I going to have to do to get the honor off\\nyou today. Yeah, it was pretty cool out there, the two of us. He obviously had\\na great round, as well, and he\\u2019s put himself in there tomorrow, and we both\\nplayed great. It was nice to kind of bounce off each other and feed off each\\nother the whole day.\\n\\nQ. Just interested more in the psychology of that potential 61. How early was\\nthat in your mind as something that could happen, and how if at all does that\\ninfluence you?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, when you go out in 29, you think, wow, I have a good day\\ngoing here, and you have 10 that\\u2019s a pretty gettable par-5. I think when I\\nholed the putt on 14, I was like, here we go, yeah, this is a good chance. But\\nobviously 15 is a tricky hole and 16 is a tough hole. But it felt like I\\nplayed them very well. Obviously to birdie 17, that\\u2019s when I knew I just\\nreally wanted to hit a good tee shot on the last. I pushed it a little bit and\\nlaid it up, and I hit a great wedge shot, and yeah, obviously just missed the\\nputt. Yeah, it was in my mind from about 14 onwards.\\n\\nQ. It looked as if you looked straight up 18 as if you were going to hit \\u2013\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Yeah, the ball was kind of sitting up in the rough. I had 170\\nyards from the fairway to the other side of the water, and I probably could\\nhave done it, but it felt like it was maybe a silly decision to go for it\\nunder the circumstances. I knew if I made 5 that I\\u2019m still in the tournament.\\nIf I made 6, I\\u2019d be livid with myself. I felt like it was probably a bit too\\nrisky to take on. I hit a poor lay-up to be honest, and I got fortunate that\\nit was in the semi-rough, and I had a perfect number from there. And I hit a\\ngreat shot then after that.\\n\\nQ. Leading up to this week, did you see anything in your game specifically\\nthat might have fore shadowed something like this? What was clicking for you?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I feel like tee-to-green, I\\u2019ve been as good as I\\u2019ve ever been\\nthis year, and then I come out the first two days, it was probably the worst\\nI\\u2019ve played in a long time, but my putter kept me going and kept me in the\\ntournament. Then I went to the range with my coach yesterday afternoon and\\nsort of \\u2014 it was just an alignment issue. I was set up too far left and all\\nsorts of bad things happen for me when I do that. Yeah, fixed that, and went\\nout there today, played with a little bit of freedom, and managed to do that\\nscore. Yeah, I\\u2019ve sort of felt all season that if I could warm my putter up\\nthat I could be dangerous. I kept saying it. Here I am going out in one of the\\nlast groups tomorrow, one of the last few groups tomorrow with a chance in\\nthis tournament. That\\u2019s nice. Regardless of what happens tomorrow, it\\u2019s a nice\\nposition to be in.\\n\\nQ. When is the last time you were this satisfied after a round? Seems like\\nthere\\u2019s a pretty good smile you can\\u2019t wipe off your face.\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: To be honest, I said to my coach, my agent after the first two\\nrounds, the last two days, I feel like I\\u2019ve gotten a lot out of my golf this\\nweek. I played poorly the first two days I felt, got a lot out of the rounds,\\nand it\\u2019s been a while since I\\u2019ve felt like that. It\\u2019s a nice feeling to have.\\nGoing to enjoy it and kind of get out tomorrow and then just try and do it\\nagain.\\n\\nQ. Were you a little surprised the leaders didn\\u2019t push out a little farther\\nyesterday afternoon, and did that give you a little jump start knowing that\\nyou weren\\u2019t as far back as you started? Then how does the mindset change\\ntomorrow after knowing you needed to go low today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Somebody asked me this question after the first \\u2014 maybe it was\\nyesterday. Like it happens every week on the PGA TOUR. Somebody goes low the\\nfirst day and everyone thinks 25-under is going to win or 20-under is going to\\nwin. It doesn\\u2019t work like that. It\\u2019s a four-round event, and it takes a lot to\\nget to the 72nd hole on Sunday. I sort of felt like they weren\\u2019t going to go\\ntoo far away. Obviously the leaders have played some really solid golf and had\\nsome really good scores, but there are a lot of difficult holes out there, as\\nwell. Albeit it\\u2019s soft and there\\u2019s not much wind, if you play good it\\u2019s\\nscorable, but if you hit a bad shot, you\\u2019re going to get in trouble. If you\\nhit an average shot you could get in trouble, as well. What am I going to \\u2014\\nwhat was the \\u2013\\n\\nQ. Tomorrow\\u2019s mindset. You go low today\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I just have to \\u2014 look, I\\u2019m going to enjoy this round. I\\u2019ll go\\nback, put my feet up tonight, have some dinner, hopefully get some sleep and\\nget out there and just fight hard tomorrow and go out and give it my best.\\n\\nQ. Following up on the question with smiling out there, was there something\\nyou took from the Zurich win that might have carried over to today?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Look, it was obviously nice to win in Zurich. But if you had of\\nseen me last week, I wasn\\u2019t smiling on the golf course. It\\u2019s quite hollow when\\nyou don\\u2019t get on very well. So yeah, obviously, look, winning at the Zurich\\nClassic was great for a lot of things, FedExCup, stuff like that, just to get\\nanother win under my belt. It gives you a lot of confidence. Yeah, it was nice\\nto do that. But then you go on to the next week, and it doesn\\u2019t make a\\ndifference what you\\u2019ve done last week. I think that\\u2019s the great thing about\\nthis game. It doesn\\u2019t matter what you\\u2019ve done last week, you\\u2019ve still got next\\nweek and the week after. Look, even if I go out and win tomorrow or go out and\\nfinish 20th tomorrow, we\\u2019ve still got the Canadian Open in a couple of weeks\\nand Memorial and the U.S. Open. Still got a lot to look forward to. Yeah, it\\nwas nice to get the win at the Zurich, but you just move on quickly and get on\\nto the next event.\\n\\nQ. What\\u2019s the lowest you\\u2019ve ever shot anywhere, even if it\\u2019s not official?\\nHave you ever shot below 60?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: I remember having a chance one day, and I don\\u2019t normally go out\\nand keep scores, but if I get on a run, you sort of think, I\\u2019m actually doing\\nall right here. I think I maybe shot 61 before, 60, 61, but I\\u2019ve never shot\\nbelow. Actually I\\u2019ve shot 60 before. I had a putt for a 59 before. And I\\ndidn\\u2019t make it. (Laughing).\\n\\nQ. We see a lot of guys when they\\u2019re out on the course will try to keep their\\nemotions to a minimum. I think you would be categorized as one of the more\\nemotive players in pro golf. Do you feel like it\\u2019s an asset at all that you\\nkind of wear your heart on your sleeve?\\n\\nSHANE LOWRY: Well, I think I\\u2019m doing okay.

9:00 AM\\n\\nMullingar welcomed a new mayor this week as Cllr Mick Dollard was officially\\nelected to the role during a meeting of the Municipal District of Mullingar\\nKinnegad. The change in leadership marked the conclusion of Cllr Ken Glynn\\u2019s\\nterm, which he described as ending \\u201con a high\\u201d.\\n\\nIn a wide-ranging address, Cllr Glynn reflected on several key milestones\\nduring his tenure. Earlier on Monday, he took part in the ceremonial sod-\\nturning for the long-awaited Saunders Bridge pedestrian crossing with county\\ncathaoirleach, Liam McDaniel. He said the project is a vital safety\\nimprovement for the community and expressed hope that another safe crossing\\nnear Millmount would be approved soon.\\n\\nCllr Glynn also referenced ongoing traffic issues at the McDonald\\u2019s Junction,\\nsaying the recent changes implemented there would be closely monitored. \\u201cIf I\\ndon\\u2019t see clear improvement, I will be pushing for the roundabout option,\\u201d he\\nstated firmly.\\n\\nDuring his term, Cllr Glynn said he was honoured to present several local\\nheroes with Addresses of Recognition, including Milly Walsh for his promotion\\nof Mullingar, Col\\u00e1iste Mhuire for bringing home the first Leinster Colleges\\ntitle since 1983; the Mullingar First Responders, Mullingar Town Band \\u2013 and he\\nhas proposed one for Caoimhe and Aoife O\\u2019Brien of Lakeside Wheelers, who\\nparticipated in the 2024 Elite World Championships.\\n\\nA notable moment for Cllr Glynn was officiating at the opening of Murty\\nQuinn\\u2019s Military Museum at Columb Barracks. \\u201cMurty\\u2019s collection was\\nbreathtaking,\\u201d he said, urging Westmeath County Council to support a permanent\\ntown museum that could house the collection and meet the long-held aspirations\\nof the community.\\n\\nHe also didn\\u2019t shy away from criticism, particularly citing a lack of\\ncommunity consultation on projects such as the Ash Road works. \\u201cConsultation\\nis one of the greatest tools in local democracy,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut acting on that\\nconsultation is equally important.\\u201d\\n\\nLooking ahead, he noted positive developments including the upcoming launch of\\nthe Mullingar Town Bus service and renewed lobbying for the reopening of the\\nMullingar to Athlone rail line. Cllr Glynn closed by thanking council staff\\nand fellow members, and expressed his hopes that transparency and inclusive\\ncommunications would remain priorities under the new mayor.\\n\\nFollowing his address, colleagues from across the political spectrum praised\\nCllr Glynn\\u2019s leadership. Cllr David Jones noted his impartiality, while Cllr\\nNiall Gaffney called him \\u201cfantastically fair\\u201d and a great mentor for new\\ncouncillors. Cllr Alfie Devine described him as \\u201cknowledgeable and\\nforthcoming,\\u201d and Cllr Bill Collentine and Cllr Aoife Davitt both acknowledged\\nthe extensive work he had done for the town.\\n\\n**Cllr Dollard elected as mayor**\\n\\nCllr Aoife Davitt proposed the nomination of Cllr Mick Dollard for the role of\\nmayor for the year to come, highlighting his decades of experience in local\\ngovernment, starting with the Town Commission in 1984. Her motion was seconded\\nby Cllr Alfie Devine.\\n\\nIn his acceptance speech, Cllr Dollard thanked his proposer, seconder, and the\\nMullingar electorate. He paid tribute to his predecessor, Cllr Glynn, noting\\nhis strong political heritage, as his father Camillus Glynn served extensively\\nin local governance.\\n\\n\\u201cI look forward to continuing much of the work Ken initiated,\\u201d said Cllr\\nDollard. He expressed a strong desire to see a long-term blueprint for the\\ndevelopment of Mullingar and vowed to support housing, voluntary\\norganisations, and strategic funding applications. \\u201cWe will be judged not just\\ntoday, but on our activities 50 or 100 years from now,\\u201d he stated.\\n\\nCllr Dollard reaffirmed his independence, saying, \\u201cAs an independent, I\\u2019m\\ncommitted to treating everyone fairly and equally,\\u201d and pledged to work\\nconstructively with council officials and staff.\\n\\n**Cllr Collentine named deputy mayor**\\n\\nCllr Ken Glynn proposed, and Cllr Aoife Davitt seconded, the appointment of\\nCllr Bill Collentine as deputy mayor. With good humour, Cllr Glynn joked that\\nCllr Collentine could expect \\u201clots of phone calls\\u201d in his new role.\\n\\nThe meeting concluded with routine business, including the adoption of a new\\nschedule of meetings for the council.\\n\\n  * [ Municipal District of Mullingar Kinnegad ](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/municipal-district-of-mullingar-kinnegad/)\\n  * \\n\\nPublished: Thu 12 Jun 2025, 9:00 AM\\n\\n  \\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=f8c59232-b2d5-5138-bc45-c5c144f48bc8&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.795&crop_h=0.99999&width=1200&height=675&x=0.16&y=1.0E-5)SportMore\\nthan 40 runners from Harriers in Dublin Marathon6 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/more-than-40-runners-from-\\nharriers-in-dublin-marathon/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=9701ec99-7641-5d87-9263-d50661085ad6&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84428&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.06379)NewsHorseleap\\npub raises over \\u20ac6k for Alzheimer Society of Ireland7 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/horseleap-pub-raises-\\nover-e6k-for-alzheimer-society-of-ireland/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=dbebbe27-d5a0-5f3f-881e-0f945345da10&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.9997&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675)NewsPaddy\\u2019s\\n\\u2018acts of kindness and love\\u2019 will be remembered9 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/paddys-acts-of-kindness-and-\\nlove-will-be-remembered/)\\n\\n[![](https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io?uuid=b2c93291-06a1-57aa-9b0d-d689414d00cb&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.925&crop_h=0.99999&width=1200&height=675&x=0.0375&y=1.0E-5)NewsClonmellon\\nwoman reported missing now locatedGarda\\u00ed in Westmeath have said that a woman\\nwho had been reported missing has been located.12 hours\\nago](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/2025/10/27/118064/)\\n\\nBack to top __\\n\\n[![](https://static.ew.cmg.infomaker.io/wp-\\ncontent/uploads/sites/2/2019/04/01153504/westmeath-\\nlogo-300x105.png)](https://www.westmeathexaminer.ie/)\\n\\n  \\nServing the people of Mullingar and north Westmeath with quality local news\\nsince 1882  \\n  \\n**Editor:** Brian O'Loughlin  \\n**Address:** Blackhall Place, Mullingar, Co.

There were other troubling signs that all was not well with the effort to aid Ukraine. For example, although the\\nCAESAR mobile artillery system\\nhad proven very useful to the June 2022 bombardment and recapture of\\nSnake Island\\nand dominated the battle elsewhere, the Ukrainians were having difficulty with the maintenance of the 18 systems and the solution was problematic.

The annual budget will thus increase from 32 billion in 2017 to 69 billion euros in 2030, a doubling of funding for the armed forces. This budget must notably cover investments in the\\nFrench nuclear arsenal\\n, the construction of a new aircraft carrier and the increase in the number of armed forces. The government also plans to raise the age limit for reservists to 70, whereas it is currently between 62 and 65, with the objective of providing the armed forces with 300,000 soldiers, including 100,000 reservists. The intelligence services should also see their budget increase by 60%.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nIn March 2024, Lecornu announced that\\nLes Forges de Tarbes\\nwould henceforth have the capacity to produce 4,000 artillery shells per month.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nIt produced 1,000 per month as of February 2022, the start of the\\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\\n.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nAlso in March 2024, according to Lecornu, the Russian war machine was able to fire between 10,000 and 15,000 shells per day in Ukraine war.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nIn July 2024, Lecornu and his counterparts from Germany, Italy and Poland signed a letter of intent to develop ground-launched cruise missiles with a range beyond 500\\u00a0km (310 miles).\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nPrime Minister (September 2025\\u2013present)\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain articles:\\nFirst Lecornu government\\nand\\nSecond Lecornu government\\nLecornu was appointed Prime Minister on 9 September 2025 by President Emmanuel Macron.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nHe succeeded Fran\\u00e7ois Bayrou, who was forced to resign on the same day following the failure of a vote of confidence in the National Assembly the day before.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nShortly after his appointment, Le Figaro and Paris Match revealed that S\\u00e9bastien Lecornu visited former President Nicolas Sarkozy at his offices in the\\n8th arrondissement of Paris\\n,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nwho assured him of his friendship and support.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nOn 13 September 2025, in an interview with the regional daily press, he announced that he would abandon the abolition and reinstating of the two public holidays, an unpopular measure sought by his predecessor Fran\\u00e7ois Bayrou.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\n[\\n41\\n]\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nTwo days later, he announced the end of \\\"lifetime benefits\\\" for former members of the Government as of 1 January 2026.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nOn 6 October 2025, Lecornu unveiled a cabinet that was similar to previous governments.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nHe resigned hours later amidst threats across the political spectrum to oust him.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nMacron then tasked Lecornu with 48-hour talks to stabilise the government.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nLecornu also assumed the role of the minister of the armed forces on an interim basis after\\nBruno Le Maire\\nresigned after only a few hours in office.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nOn 10 October 2025, Macron reinstated Lecornu as Prime Minister,\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nresulting in similar criticism.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nIn an address before the National Assembly, Lecornu said he supported the suspension of pension reforms until after the 2027 presidential election,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nwhich led the Socialists to pledge its support for him against a no-confidence motion.\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nThis led to Lecornu surviving two successive no-confidence motions filed by\\nLa France Insoumise\\nand the\\nNational Rally\\nrespectively on 16 October.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nPolitical positions\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nLecornu described himself as \\\"rather\\nGaullist\\n,\\nS\\u00e9guinist\\n, fundamentally right-wing\\\",\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nas well as \\\"liberal and\\nEuropean\\n\\\",\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nwhile Le Monde described him in 2022 as \\\"not really liberal or all that\\nsouverainist\\n\\\", allowing himself to be \\\"sucked in by the identity temptations of the right, while knowing how to make himself appreciated on his left flank.\\\"\\n[\\n56\\n]\\nAgainst what he calls \\\"l\\u2019excuse sociale\\\"\\n(\\\"the social excuses\\\")\\n, he threatened in 2016 to not proceed with the increase to the\\nRevenu de solidarit\\u00e9 active\\n(RSA) decided by\\nManuel Valls\\n's team as part of the\\ngovernment\\n's plan to combat poverty, and denounced a \\\"clientelism that reeks of old-fashioned politics.\\\"\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nS\\u00e9bastien Lecornu opposed same-sex marriage in 2012.

Mattarella\\nOMRI\\nOMCA\\n(\\nItalian:\\n[\\u02c8s\\u025brd\\u0292o\\nmatta\\u02c8r\\u025blla]\\n; born 23 July 1941) is an Italian politician who has been serving as\\nPresident of Italy\\nsince 2015. He is the longest-serving president in the\\nhistory of the Italian Republic\\n. Since\\nGiorgio Napolitano\\n's death in 2023, Mattarella is the only living Italian president.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA\\nCatholic leftist\\npolitician, Mattarella was a leading member of the\\nChristian Democracy\\n(DC) party from the early 1980s until its dissolution. He served as\\nMinister for Parliamentary Relations\\nfrom 1987 to 1989, and\\nMinister of Education\\nfrom 1989 to 1990. In 1994, Mattarella was among the founders of the\\nItalian People's Party\\n(PPI), serving as\\nDeputy Prime Minister of Italy\\nfrom 1998 to 1999, and\\nMinister of Defence\\nfrom 1999 to 2001.
