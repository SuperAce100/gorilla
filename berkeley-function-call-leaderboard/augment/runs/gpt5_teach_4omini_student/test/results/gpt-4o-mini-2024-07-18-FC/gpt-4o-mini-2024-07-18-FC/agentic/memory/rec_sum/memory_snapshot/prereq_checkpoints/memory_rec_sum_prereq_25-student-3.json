    "memory": "User has been attending the VR/AR Club on and off since their sophomore year, initially getting hooked on it after starting research in immersive analytics. The club is hands-on, with a VR lab in the engineering building that includes headsets, sensors, and quirky prototypes built by past members. They host demos where members showcase their latest projects, ranging from mini-games to experimental augmented reality interfaces. Recently, someone presented an AR tutor concept for advanced math that provides hints or 3D demonstrations when pointing a phone at an equation. User finds the creativity in the club inspiring and appreciates the supportive vibe around emerging tech. User occasionally attends events at the student-run radio station, including open-mic nights where people sing, read poetry, or perform stand-up comedy. They recall a memorable night when a friend from their Distributed Systems class performed an acoustic set, surprising everyone with his soulful voice. User appreciates these moments as reminders that there\u2019s always more to someone than what is seen during coding sessions or group projects. User describes the campus as having iconic spots, including a huge central lawn where students hang out between classes and where student organizations set up booths. They see fliers for various groups, from an a cappella group to an environmental activism society, often accompanied by freebies like stickers or candy to attract sign-ups. User's personal weakness is free pizza, which makes them more likely to join clubs. The lawn is also the site of major campus events, such as the annual Tech Fest, where project teams showcase their prototypes and recruiters look for innovative ideas, making it a significant event for engineering and CS students.User describes campus culture as fairly collaborative, with some competition among seniors for top internships or job offers, but overall, students want to help each other succeed. They recall their second year when the campus hackathon was a huge eye-opener, with thousands of students from various backgrounds participating for 24 or 36 hours straight. User found it chaotic but exhilarating, witnessing beginners learning GitHub basics while advanced teams worked on complex machine learning projects. They formed a small team with casual acquaintances, and the bond they created during the all-nighter\u2014eating stale pizza, debugging code, and cheering each other on\u2014was a unique experience. User associates this vibe with campus life, emphasizing the friendships forged through shared experiences and challenges.User has moved off-campus but describes dorm life as a significant part of campus culture during their first two years. They stayed in a dorm specifically for engineering majors, humorously called \"The Engi-House.\" User recalls legendary late-night coding sessions in the common lounge, where students worked on assignments while others streamed e-sports tournaments. Although the environment could get intense with stressed-out engineers fueled by energy drinks, it also provided a supportive atmosphere where help was readily available. Beyond academics, they held potlucks, watched Netflix together, and even hosted a small talent show to unwind.User has been involved in volunteering at outreach events organized by the CS department, particularly during a \"Tech for Good\" day where local high school students come to campus to learn about programming and problem-solving. User helps run mini-workshops on topics like web development and basic Python. They find it rewarding to see younger students light up when they create a simple game or animated webpage. User reflects on their own experiences at that age, feeling overwhelmed by the vastness of the tech world, and takes pride in giving students a positive first experience. They appreciate that events like this highlight a different side of campus life, focusing on community engagement and inspiring the next generation to get excited about STEM fields.User notes that the campus has a lively social scene, with Greek life available, though they never joined a fraternity. They found that specialized clubs are the best way to meet people with shared interests. A friend of theirs joined the Robotics Team and found a second family there, spending weekends with them and going out for movies and dinner. User has grown closer to members of the VR/AR Club and the CS Society, enjoying time together that goes beyond academics, including joking around, complaining about cafeteria food, and planning weekend trips to local hiking trails.User is about to experience Senior Week for the first time, which is a series of events leading up to graduation, including a formal dance, a carnival, and a day for seniors to take pictures in their caps and gowns around iconic campus landmarks. They\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a bittersweet experience, serving as the last hurrah before everyone scatters. User's older friends who graduated last year described it as one of the best weeks of their college life, filled with laughter, nostalgia, and a sense of the journey coming to an end. User feels both excited and anxious about it, reflecting on the many memories made over four years and the reality of no longer being a student.User describes a campus tradition involving a big Rivalry Game where their sports teams face off against their biggest rival college in various sports. Even though they are not a dedicated sports fan, they love the energy on campus during that week, with people dressing in school colors, painting their faces, and parading with banners. The night before the big football game features a massive pep rally with fireworks, creating an electric atmosphere. Friends gather in dorm lounges or local bars to watch and cheer, and celebrations can last all weekend if they win. Even in defeat, they find ways to commiserate together, making it a unifying moment for everyone, from business majors to art students to engineers.User notes that their school\u2019s e-sports team has gained official recognition, expanding the campus sports scene beyond traditional sports like basketball and football. The school now has an arena for e-sports, featuring a wide seating area and a big screen for streaming competitions live. It\u2019s common for over a hundred students to gather and cheer on the team during League of Legends or Overwatch matches. User expresses surprise at how e-sports has become a legitimate campus institution, highlighting the changing times and the broader definition of competition and community.User describes an annual event called the \"Midnight Breakfast\" during finals week, where stressed-out students head to the dining hall at midnight for pancakes and cereal. Despite sounding ridiculous, it serves as a huge morale booster, with professors serving food and the school band performing. It provides a collective break from studying, reminding students that they are not alone in their anxiety about final exams. User appreciates traditions like this that foster fun and camaraderie during high-pressure times, highlighting the genuine effort to support students.User believes that campus life is what you make of it, emphasizing the importance of exploring, meeting new people, and joining clubs to enrich the experience. They acknowledge the challenge of getting lost in the workload as a Computer Science major but find attending events, volunteering, and connecting with various communities to be incredibly rewarding. User reflects on their four years, noting they will remember not only late-night coding but also silly game nights in the dorm, Tech Fest presentations, hackathon adrenaline, and cheers at the Rivalry Game. They express gratitude for embracing all that campus has to offer and offer to give a quick tour to show favorite spots and introduce clubs, highlighting that there\u2019s something for everyone."
