            "0": "User has Type 2 Diabetes and has been taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily for several years. Their A1C is around 6.9%.

            "1": "User takes losartan 50 mg once daily for high blood pressure, keeping readings mostly in the 135-140/80-90 mmHg range.

            "3": "User has osteoarthritis and takes acetaminophen as needed for mild pain. For more severe joint pain, their doctor prescribed meloxicam 7.5 mg, which they don't take daily to avoid overdoing it on NSAIDs. User finds meloxicam helpful for stiffness in their knees and hands. Their doctor suggested trying glucosamine supplements, but they are unsure of their effectiveness.",

            "5": "User takes atorvastatin 10 mg daily to help with cholesterol management. Their LDL was 130 mg/dL and triglycerides were 140 mg/dL, prompting their doctor to prescribe a low-dose statin.

            "6": "User takes a daily multivitamin, omega-3 supplements for heart health, and probiotics for digestion. Since their gallbladder was removed a few years ago, they sometimes take digestive enzymes when eating heavier foods, as losing their gallbladder changed the way they digest fatty foods.",
            "7": "User monitors potential medication interactions. They are cautious with meloxicam and losartan, as NSAIDs can affect kidney function, so they try not to take meloxicam too often. User also takes their thyroid medication separately from calcium and iron supplements to avoid absorption interference.",
