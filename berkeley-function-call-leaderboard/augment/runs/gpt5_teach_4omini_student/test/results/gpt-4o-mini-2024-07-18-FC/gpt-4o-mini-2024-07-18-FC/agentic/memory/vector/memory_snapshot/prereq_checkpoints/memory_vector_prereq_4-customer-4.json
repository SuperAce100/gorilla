            "7": "Michael has a sleek grinder and vacuum-sealed canisters to keep his coffee beans fresh.",
            "8": "Michael appreciates the design and quality of the coffee machines and accessories from the e-commerce platform. He was drawn to the sleek, modern stainless-steel aesthetic of the espresso machine. After multiple orders, including the espresso machine, extra frothing pitchers, milk thermometers, cleaning tablets, and a digital scale, he finds everything durable and well-constructed.

            "13": "Michael appreciates the discounts and promotions for first-time buyers and suggests implementing a loyalty or rewards program for returning customers.

He used a credit card last time but is interested in any special financing options that might pair well with a subscription, if available. He appreciates the option to spread out payments for pricier kitchen gadgets.",
