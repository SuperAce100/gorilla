    "memory": "User's dog Archie is three years old now, and they got him when User was in their second year of college. Their parents surprised both User and their sister with him one winter break. User and their sister had always talked about wanting a dog, especially a big, friendly breed that likes to run around and play catch. User vividly remembers the moment they first saw Archie\u2014tiny and fluffy, wagging his little tail like it was Christmas every day. Even though User was only back home for about three weeks during that break, they spent every moment getting to know him, taking him for short walks(he was too small for long ones at first), and teaching him commands. User recalls how Archie would tumble over himself trying to learn \"sit\" and \"stay.\" It's wild how big he has gotten now\u2014definitely not that little fur ball anymore!User lives on campus and visits home on some weekends or during breaks, so their parents do most of the day-to-day care for Archie. However, User video calls their parents almost daily\u2014a habit they've maintained since their freshman year. Archie seems to recognize User's voice during these calls, and their mom tilts the phone so he can see User. Archie goes nuts, wagging his tail and whining like he\u2019s about to jump through the screen. These moments are equal parts hilarious and heartwarming, helping User de-stress from back-to-back coding assignments and infinite debugging sessions. User believes that even though dogs may not perceive images on screens like humans do, Archie 100% knows something\u2019s up, possibly triggered by User's voice.User feels lucky with their family. Their dad is a software engineer, which inspired User to pursue computer science. They used to do small coding exercises together in high school, where he would challenge User with puzzles and problems, sparking their fascination with logic and technology. User's mom works as a nurse and is the most caring person they know, serving as the emotional backbone of the family. She always picks up User's calls for pep talks or worries about exams, even late at night. User finds a healthy balance between their parents: the analytical edge from their dad and the empathetic side from their mom. User's sister is younger, just turned sixteen, and despite the age difference, they have always been close. She introduced User to some of their favorite mobile games. User describes her as a ball of energy, constantly on social media, playing new games, or looking for trends. She jokes about overshadowing User in the tech scene, and User thinks she might be right.Every time User goes home, Archie greets them like they\u2019ve been gone for centuries, bounding around and doing that little circle dance in excitement. One of their family traditions is going on a Saturday morning hike whenever User is in town. They pack some snacks, load Archie into their SUV, and drive out to a trail about twenty minutes away. The path isn\u2019t super long, but it has a great view at the summit of a small bluff overlooking a lake. Archie loves it\u2014he\u2019s got endless energy. By the time they reach the top, he\u2019s chasing squirrels and sniffing every tree. Watching him run around like that reminds User to appreciate the small things, as they can get so wrapped up in code and classes that they forget to just breathe and enjoy nature.User's extended family includes their grandparents, who live a state away and mean a lot to User. User's grandma still teases them about the time they broke her antique vase in middle school while throwing a mini football around her living room, a story that gets retold almost every Thanksgiving. Growing up, User's family valued spending time with relatives, making holiday gatherings a big deal. Thanksgiving is a potluck extravaganza with various dishes that make you want to hibernate until Christmas. Archie tries to snag anything that drops on the floor, but they learned the hard way that he has a sensitive stomach after he got into leftover turkey bones one year, leading to a late-night veterinary visit. Since then, User's family has been super careful about what 'people food' Archie can get.User finds it interesting how family shapes who you become. Even though they are on their own at college, User realizes that a lot of the patience and resilience they rely on while working through tough programming projects comes from their parents. User's dad taught them how to stay calm and break down problems, while their mom showed them how to be patient and empathetic, even in frustrating situations, like when a project partner doesn't pull their weight or code isn't cooperating. User's sister pushes them to stay up on new trends so they don't become a relic in their twenties. User sometimes writes about personal stories, like Archie or silly moments with their sister, in personal statements for scholarships or grad school applications because those experiences matter to them.User describes their family as supportive, close-knit, and lively. The way they come together around Archie, fussing over him or laughing at his antics, shows User what unconditional love looks like. Despite being a busy fourth-year with internship interviews, clubs, research, and other responsibilities, User appreciates having a place\u2014and a family\u2014where they are always welcome, dog hair and all. This sense of belonging keeps User going, as they know they can always count on home to recharge them, which definitely includes Archie leaping into their arms the moment they walk through the door.User feels lucky with their family.
