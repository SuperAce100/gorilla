    "memory": "User's crush is in their advanced algorithms class, and they ended up on the same team for a project about a month ago. Working on the project allowed User to get to know her better, and they found her funny and brilliant. During group Zoom calls, she kept the mood light with witty jokes, which User appreciates, especially since she doesn't get overly stressed by academic pressure. User enjoys her dry, sarcastic sense of humor. She is dedicated to her studies, minoring in mathematics with a passion for discrete structures. User's interests are more software-oriented, focusing on system design, user interface, and data science. Their strengths complement each other well, as she helped User with complex analysis and combinatorial proofs during their project. User trusts her process and feels confident in her abilities. They received an A on the project, but User was primarily happy for the opportunity to collaborate with her.User is trying to figure out if their crush is interested in them beyond being a team partner or classmate. They are busy with applications for full-time jobs, an internship wanting them back after graduation, and extracurriculars. User is involved in the Robotics Club, which meets twice a week, and the sailing club, which they have been passionate about since childhood. They also try to work out every morning to maintain their sanity. User feels they barely have enough hours in the day to keep up with their responsibilities but wants to carve out time for someone they really like.User is considering asking their crush to grab coffee after class at a cute caf\u00e9 off campus that has amazing chai lattes and a great studying ambiance in the late afternoon. They plan to casually mention needing a break from coding to make the invitation feel natural. User is looking to see if she has a gap on Tuesday or Thursday, as those days are more flexible for them. They remind themselves that the worst-case scenario is her being busy, and they can try another day. User acknowledges the risk involved in expressing interest, even if she might see them as just another CS classmate.User has been focused on future plans, including talking to recruiters at networking events, fine-tuning their LinkedIn profile, and considering grad school. Their parents are supportive but eager for User to land a solid job right out of college. User's little sister occasionally texts to check in and teases them about any romantic interests. User's family is very close, and while they usually share everything, they are keeping their feelings for their crush under wraps for now. They want to feel certain about their feelings and the potential direction before discussing it with their family, as they want to avoid premature wedding planning.User is worried about losing focus and getting distracted by romantic drama, given their tight schedule. They use a Google Calendar that beeps every twenty minutes to remind them of their commitments, which include coding sessions, grocery runs, FaceTiming their dog(a golden retriever they miss), tasks for campus organizations, and occasional online gaming with friends. User believes that a bit of excitement or a spark from their crush could be motivational rather than distracting, potentially providing an extra energy boost during their last two semesters.User really likes their crush and plans to be honest when asking her out for coffee. They intend to say, 'Hey, I\u2019ve loved working together, and I\u2019d really like to get to know you more outside of algorithms class. Want to grab coffee sometime?' User anticipates feeling nervous, with their heart pounding, but recognizes that this is part of the process. They are trying to keep expectations realistic, understanding that it might not lead anywhere or could remain a friendship. However, they feel genuinely excited about the idea of connecting with someone beyond academic discussions.User feels it's surreal to talk about crushes at this stage in college, where everyone is busy and stressed, but they also recognize it as a time to meet interesting people. They feel they've found someone they want to get closer to and plan to wait until after their next group meeting to ask her out for coffee. User intends to crack a small joke about surviving advanced algorithms together as a way to lighten the mood. They believe that even if she says no, they will have tried, and they have a feeling she might say yes."
