    "memory": "User values friendship highly, considering their closest friends at college as a second family. After four years at college, they believe that while they love studying computer science, the people they've met along the way are what keep them grounded and happy. Initially, User was nervous about making friends when they first arrived on campus, as it was their first time living away from home. However, they ended up forming tight bonds that have made the stresses and workload of being a CS major feel more manageable.User's roommate and best friend from freshman year is Tony. They clicked right away over a conversation about a piece of software User was trying to prototype for an Intro to Programming class project. Although Tony is a mechanical engineering major and not in computer science, they would bounce ideas off each other late into the night and discovered they had more in common than they initially thought. Both love working with their hands in different ways: User enjoys coding and designing logic, while Tony loves building things physically. They have collaborated on a few cross-disciplinary robotics projects and have grown closer due to their shared interests. Tony is someone User can always call when feeling overwhelmed with an assignment or when they want to grab a pizza after a long day.User has a couple of friends from the campus sailing club, where they discovered many CS students who enjoy decompressing by hitting the water. The mix of personalities creates a unique camaraderie, as they all share an inclination for problem-solving and sometimes treat sailing strategy like a puzzle. The bond on the boat is unlike anything User has experienced in other clubs, requiring trust and motivation among team members. They meet at odd hours, often early in the morning, to catch the best sailing conditions, fostering a deep mutual respect as they see each other's strengths and vulnerabilities in a high-stakes environment. User feels a sense of accomplishment when they receive a thumbs-up from a friend after successfully maneuvering a tricky tack. One friend, Mariah, has become a close confidante, encouraging User to apply for a more challenging research position in data science and believing in User's skills.As a fourth-year student, User has made many connections through computer science classes, including study groups, group projects, and interactions with peers in the lab during late-night coding sessions. They feel a sense of solidarity from these experiences, especially during challenging times. User recalls a particularly difficult systems programming course in sophomore year, where the final project involved building a mini operating system kernel from scratch. They bonded with Carla, another CS major, over pizza at 3 a.m. while troubleshooting memory management bugs, leading to one of User's most treasured friendships.User has formed good friendships at the gym, where working out serves as an escape for them. They often see the same group of people in the early mornings, which has turned into a friendly circle. One of those friends, Dean, is a fellow computer science major focused on machine learning and hardware acceleration projects. Their conversations between sets evolved into comparing notes on classes, leading to a friendship where they share nutritional tips, workout regimens, and even game together. Dean introduced User to a new co-op adventure game, making their friendship about mutual support and pushing each other to improve in various areas of life.User has a circle of friends from gaming, which is a cherished part of their life. While not a hardcore gamer, User enjoys spending weekends playing multiplayer strategy games as a mental break from coding and research. They participate in an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center, where they enjoy quality time with friends, sharing laughs, inside jokes, and the excitement of gaming together. User made a great friend, Derek, through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught User techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support.User has formed friendships in unexpected places, such as the campus library, where they spend time studying in a quieter environment. As a fourth-year CS major, User's schedule is loaded with advanced courses, an intense research project, and extracurricular commitments, making the library a go-to spot for peace. Over the years, they've encountered the same faces, including Jackson, a law student who reads case studies next to User's cryptography textbooks. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates, particularly around the political and ethical implications of new technologies. Their friendship, while more intellectual than some others, is valued for broadening User's perspective beyond code and servers.User has made great friends in unexpected, everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline and half-asleep, User complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with her own mechanical engineering lab issues, overheard and they commiserated, sharing a laugh. They ended up sitting together for coffee, bonding over academic stress, and exchanged contact information. Although she might not be a 'best friend' in terms of constant hangouts, their relationship is positive and supportive, having started organically.User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen doesn't reflect their experience. Instead, they form deep connections, especially during high-pressure times. User describes being in labs critiquing each other's code and collaborating on Slack until late at night to solve bugs, emphasizing that these challenges create bonds. They highlight that it's not always about competition, but rather about collaboration and supporting one another.As a fourth-year student, User is facing the impending graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. While they are excited about the future\u2014internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school\u2014they also dread the thought of friends scattering to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. They find it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during their college years.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in other friends, like Carla, who is applying to master\u2019s programs abroad. They have promised to visit each other if one of them ends up in Europe.User expresses extreme gratitude for the friendships made through various activities, including sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, emphasizing that there's more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that feeling like they can call these people friends is a true measure of success. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each friend with them, viewing friends not just as chapters in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts."
