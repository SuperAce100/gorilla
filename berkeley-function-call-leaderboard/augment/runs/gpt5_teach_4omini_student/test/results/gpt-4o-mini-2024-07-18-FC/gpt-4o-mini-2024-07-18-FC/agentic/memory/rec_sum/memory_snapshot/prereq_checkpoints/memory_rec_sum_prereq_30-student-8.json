    "memory": "User has a circle of friends from an informal e-sports club that meets in a common lounge at the student center. While not a hardcore gamer, User enjoys playing multiplayer strategy games on weekends as a mental break from coding and research papers. The gaming sessions provide quality time with friends, filled with laughter, inside jokes, and shared excitement during gameplay. User made a great friend, Derek, through this group; he is skilled in networking security and taught User techniques that were useful in a cybersecurity research project. Their friendship evolved naturally from a shared hobby to mutual academic support. User also formed a friendship with Jackson, a law student they met in the campus library, where User often studies for a quieter environment amidst their busy schedule as a fourth-year CS major. They started chatting during water breaks, comparing their workloads, and discovered a shared interest in debates, particularly around the political and ethical implications of new technologies. User enjoys discussing algorithmic bias with Jackson, and their friendship, while more intellectual than some others, is valued for broadening User's perspective beyond coding and technology. User has also made friends in everyday-life situations, such as in the dorm laundry room or while waiting in line for coffee. One day, feeling stressed about a research deadline, User complained under their breath about needing more time for their research code to run while waiting in a long line at the campus cafe. The person behind them, who was also dealing with her own mechanical engineering lab issues, overheard and they ended up commiserating and sharing a laugh. They sat together for coffee, bonded over academic stress, and exchanged contact information. Now, they make a point to catch up whenever they see each other on campus, forming a positive, supportive relationship that started organically. User believes that mutual respect and the shared experience of navigating the challenges of college life unite all their friendships. They note that the stereotype of computer science majors as antisocial or always behind a screen does not reflect their experience. Instead, User finds that deep connections are formed, especially due to the high workload and pressure. They often critique each other's code in labs or collaborate on Slack late into the night to solve bugs, which fosters bonding. User emphasizes that their relationships are not solely competitive; rather, they focus on collaboration and supporting one another. As a fourth-year, User is facing the impending graduation and the goodbyes that come with it. They feel excited about the future, including internships, job prospects, and possibly grad school, but also dread the thought of friends scattering to different corners of the world. User reminds themselves that some friendships are built to last, and they have discussed planning reunions, visiting each other in different cities, and staying connected online. User finds it strange to think about becoming grown adults in different jobs and possibly different time zones, but they hope to maintain the bonds forged during college.User believes that real friendship transcends geographical distance, characterized by trust, loyalty, and empathy. They learned this from Tony, who is interning across the country this semester, yet they still FaceTime regularly. User sees the same dedication in others, like Carla, who is applying to master's programs abroad. They have promised that if either of them ends up in Europe, the other will come to visit.User feels extremely grateful for the friendships made through sailing, the gym, gaming, research, and random campus encounters. They view these friendships as integral to their college experience, reminding them that there\u2019s more to the journey than just accumulating achievements for their resume. User believes that finishing a lab or logging off Zoom with the feeling of having friends to call is what true success looks like. They recognize that no matter where they end up in their career, they will carry a piece of each of these friends with them. User sees friends not just as a chapter in their life story, but as co-authors who help write the best parts."
