They are open to relocating for work, especially to tech hubs like Silicon Valley, Seattle, Austin, or Midwest cities, but are aware that moving too far could complicate visits home. User has heard from upperclassmen that remote or hybrid roles have changed the landscape, allowing for the possibility of living near family or in a comfortable location while working for a major company or innovative startup. They recognize that it's a great time to enter the tech workforce with many options available, though it can feel overwhelming to juggle them all.User is determined to keep growing their skills and avoid complacency in their career. They believe that even if they land in a role that isn't perfect, as long as they are learning\u2014whether it's new frameworks, product development approaches, or management skills\u2014they will consider it a success. Their biggest fear is stagnation, especially in the fast-paced tech field. User aims to stay curious, push their boundaries, and potentially carve out a niche as a specialist in immersive tech for data. They are exploring software engineering roles that overlap with their passions for data visualization, VR/AR technologies, and data-driven product development. They have discovered a love for making huge datasets approachable and interactive through their research experience. User is drawn to tech companies known for pushing boundaries in data analytics or immersive technologies, such as Unity, Unreal, and specialized startups in VR for healthcare or engineering. They resonate with advice from a lab mentor to 'follow the domain that excites you, not just the biggest name brand out there.' They recognize the appeal of smaller companies where they might have a bigger impact earlier on.User is a fourth-year Computer Science major who is fascinated by exploring new places and tries to travel whenever their schedule allows. They have to be strategic about planning trips due to a busy calendar filled with classes, research, campus clubs, gym, and group projects. Despite this, they have managed to squeeze in some adventures that have given them some of their favorite memories. User's mindset has shifted from thinking 'I\u2019ll figure out a direction eventually' to 'I need a solid plan or at least some prospective routes ASAP' as they approach graduation. They feel unspoken pressure to land a full-time job in industry, a spot in a grad program, or a startup venture. Currently, they are leaning towards going into the industry for 5 years but haven't ruled out grad school in the future.User has managed to squeeze in some travel adventures despite their busy schedule, which have given them some of their favorite memories.User enjoys sharing their travel experiences and is interested in discussing them.User's travel experiences have provided them with some of their favorite memories.User's travel experiences have been meaningful and memorable for them.User is interested in discussing specific travel experiences and the memories associated with them.User is open to sharing specific travel experiences and discussing the memories associated with them.User's travel experiences have been a source of joy and meaningful memories.User's travel experiences have contributed to their personal growth and joy.User's travel experiences have enriched their life and contributed to their personal growth.User's travel experiences have shaped their perspective and enriched their life.User feels unspoken pressure to land a full-time job in industry, a spot in a grad program, or a startup venture as they approach graduation.

User is currently in the thick of campus recruiting, participating in career fairs and submitting applications for software engineering or data engineering intern-to-full-time conversion roles. They completed an internship last summer at a tech startup with 9 people that specialized in data analytics software for logistics companies, where they gained valuable experience in development team operations, sprint planning, code reviews, and feature rollouts. Their tasks included building UI components for an analytics dashboard and writing data pipelines for near real-time shipping event processing, which boosted their confidence and will help them stand out in interviews. User is intrigued by the idea of continuing their research in immersive analytics or branching into human-computer interaction for large datasets. They recognize that advanced degrees can open doors to specialized R&D roles in industry labs or academia. Writing workshop papers and working on a conference submission has shown them that they enjoy deeper exploration of topics and pushing the needle forward meaningfully. However, they also want to apply what they've learned in a commercial setting before committing to another five to six years for a PhD(or two for a master\u2019s first). They are weighing the options of pursuing a master\u2019s part-time while working versus going all-in for grad school. User's involvement in various campus clubs and projects has shaped their future aspirations. They thrive on teamwork and problem-solving in high-stakes scenarios, as demonstrated by their current capstone project analyzing social media sentiment for emergency responses. They want a work environment that encourages cross-functional collaboration with designers, data scientists, product managers, and domain experts in non-tech fields, rather than being locked away on siloed tasks. User is also conscious of financial considerations, as they have some student loans and want a stable income soon after graduation. They recognize that a full-time engineering position typically comes with a decent salary, which could help them pay off debt faster. They are aware that funding for grad school can be complicated, with some PhD programs offering stipends and others not, while master\u2019s programs often require tuition payment and competitive scholarships. They see a good job in industry as a way to alleviate financial strain and gain career momentum while deciding whether to return to school. User is mindful of the hiring timeline, as many companies hire in waves for new grads. They are staying on top of deadlines and preparing for interviews, which can be grueling with algorithmic challenges, system design scenarios, and domain-specific tests. They set aside a couple of hours each week to practice problems, brush up on coding patterns, and revisit data structures and algorithms. While they don't love the interview grind, they understand its purpose. Their advanced courses, like Advanced Algorithms and Distributed Systems, are boosting their confidence for technical interviews, making them more comfortable discussing topics like concurrency, big-O notation, and architecture design trade-offs. User has received outreach from a few companies for initial chats, which feels surreal given their current student status. They are trying to stay grounded, recognizing that a recruiter message is just the beginning of the hiring process. They are optimistic but also keeping in mind the importance of having a Plan B or Plan C. They are looking into smaller companies or startups in their city or nearby tech hubs, as these roles can offer hands-on experience and the chance to learn from day one. The idea of joining a brand-new VR startup and contributing to building a product from scratch appeals to their entrepreneurial side. User has toyed with the idea of launching something of their own, potentially after gaining enough industry experience. They have a couple of ideas for VR-based training simulators or interactive data analytics platforms and are considering teaming up with talented friends from their advanced classes or research lab to spin up a small venture.
