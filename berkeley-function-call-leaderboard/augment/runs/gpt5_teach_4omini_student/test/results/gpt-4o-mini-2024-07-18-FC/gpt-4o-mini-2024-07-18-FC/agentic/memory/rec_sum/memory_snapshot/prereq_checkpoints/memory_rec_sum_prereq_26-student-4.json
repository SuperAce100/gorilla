    "memory": "User has received initial outreach from a few companies for chats, finding it surreal to be contacted by recruiters on LinkedIn while still feeling like a student managing assignments. They are trying to stay grounded, recognizing that a recruiter message is just the beginning of the hiring process. User remains optimistic but also keeps in mind the importance of having backup plans(Plan B and Plan C). They are exploring smaller companies or startups in their city and nearby tech hubs, as these roles can offer more hands-on experience. The idea of joining a new VR startup and contributing to building a product from scratch appeals to their entrepreneurial side.User has considered the idea of launching their own venture, potentially after gaining industry experience rather than immediately after graduation. They have ideas for VR-based training simulators and interactive data analytics platforms and are open to teaming up with talented friends from advanced classes or their research lab to start a small venture. User is aware of the challenges of maintaining a startup, especially without a guaranteed paycheck. Their parents have been supportive but emphasize the importance of financial independence and the realities of living expenses, encouraging them to keep their feet on the ground.User is considering family factors in their job search, as their parents live in a different state. They are open to relocating for work but recognize that moving too far could complicate visits home. User notes that upperclassmen friends who graduated last year have mentioned how remote or hybrid roles have changed the job landscape, allowing for the possibility of living near family or in a comfortable location while working for a big name or innovative startup. They acknowledge that it's a great time to enter the tech workforce with many options available, though it can feel overwhelming to juggle them all.User is determined to keep growing their skills and avoid complacency in their career. They believe that even if they land in a role that isn't perfect, as long as they are learning\u2014whether it's new frameworks, approaches to product development, or management skills\u2014they will consider it a success. Their biggest fear is stagnation, especially in the fast-moving tech field. User aims to stay curious, push their boundaries, and potentially carve out a niche as a specialist in immersive tech for data. Their next steps include finishing senior year strong, continuing interviews, evaluating offers, and hopefully making a decision by late spring. They are optimistic about the future but recognize the importance of flexibility, understanding that life can unfold in unexpected ways after graduation."
