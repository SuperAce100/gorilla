User feels welcomed at home, despite their busy schedule as a fourth-year student.\",\n    \"58\": \"User considers their closest friends at college as their second family. They have been at college for four years and believe that the people they have met keep them grounded and happy. They initially felt nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus.\",\n    \"59\": \"User finds campus life vibrant and acknowledges the challenges of keeping track of everything. As a fourth-year Computer Science student, they have seen how the culture has evolved and discovered various communities that make the campus feel like a second home.\",\n    \"75\": \"User is in their fourth year of college and feels a significant shift in mindset regarding future plans compared to their freshman year. They now feel the pressure to have a solid plan for after graduation, especially as a Computer Science major.\",\n    \"76\": \"User is exploring software engineering roles in data visualization, VR/AR technologies, and data-driven product development. They enjoy making large datasets approachable and interactive, inspired by their research experience.\",\n    \"77\": \"User is engaged in campus recruiting, attending career fairs, and submitting applications for software engineering and data engineering roles. They completed an internship at a tech startup specializing in data analytics software for logistics.\",\n    \"78\": \"User is fascinated by exploring new places and tries to travel whenever their schedule allows. As a fourth-year Computer Science major, they have to be strategic about planning trips due to a busy calendar. Despite this, they have managed to squeeze in some adventures.\"\n}\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}. If you do not know the answer, respond with {'answer': 'I do not know', 'context': 'I do not know'}. If you think the question cannot be properly answered, response with {'answer': 'I cannot answer this question', 'context': A short reason explaining why this question cannot be answered}.\n"},

User feels welcomed at home, despite their busy schedule as a fourth-year student.\",\n    \"58\": \"User considers their closest friends at college as their second family. They have been at college for four years and believe that the people they have met keep them grounded and happy. They initially felt nervous about fitting in when they first arrived on campus.\",\n    \"59\": \"User finds campus life vibrant and acknowledges the challenges of keeping track of everything. As a fourth-year Computer Science student, they have seen how the culture has evolved and discovered various communities that make the campus feel like a second home.\",\n    \"75\": \"User is in their fourth year of college and feels a significant shift in mindset regarding future plans compared to their freshman year. They now feel the pressure to have a solid plan for after graduation, especially as a Computer Science major.\",\n    \"76\": \"User is exploring software engineering roles in data visualization, VR/AR technologies, and data-driven product development. They enjoy making large datasets approachable and interactive, inspired by their research experience.\",\n    \"77\": \"User is engaged in campus recruiting, attending career fairs, and submitting applications for software engineering and data engineering roles. They completed an internship at a tech startup specializing in data analytics software for logistics.\",\n    \"78\": \"User is fascinated by exploring new places and tries to travel whenever their schedule allows. As a fourth-year Computer Science major, they have to be strategic about planning trips due to a busy calendar. Despite this, they have managed to squeeze in some adventures.\"\n}\n\n\nFor your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.
