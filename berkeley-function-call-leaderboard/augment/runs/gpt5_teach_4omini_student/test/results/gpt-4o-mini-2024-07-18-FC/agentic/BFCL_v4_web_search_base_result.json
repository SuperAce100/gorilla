Sometimes, it is even called a \\\"friend of reform.\\\" Yoon Dong-seop (63), President of Yonsei University, is a surgeon who skillfully wields that scalpel. As an authority in the deep areas of the human body, particularly in the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas fields, he temporarily put down the scalpel and transformed into the CEO leading Yonsei University in February last year, steering its direction. On March 27, Asia Economy met President Yoon at Underwood Hall, imbued with the 140-year spirit of Yonsei. His eyes sparkled behind his glasses when talking about the \\\"Yonsei spirit\\\" and \\\"Yonsei's future.\\\" The following is a Q&A.\\nYoon Dong-seop, President of Yonsei University, is being interviewed by Asia Economy at the Yonsei University Main Building in Sinchon, Seoul. Photo by Jo Yong-jun\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\n\\\"Leap to a Quantum Research Hub, Elevate South Korea's Status and Secure Future Growth Engines\\\"\\n-I heard you will soon visit the University of Cambridge in the UK.\\n\\u25b2Yonsei University is a world-class university in terms of global capabilities. We have student exchanges and joint research with 740 universities in 77 countries. I will visit not only the UK but also several places such as Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland. At Cambridge, we will sign a joint research MOU on quantum computing, attend an AI conference, and discuss new drug development projects. (On the 3rd, Yonsei signed an MOU with Cambridge to strengthen academic exchange and research cooperation in the field of quantum science and technology.) Cambridge is the cradle of physics research in human history, from Newton's classical mechanics to Stephen Hawking's quantum mechanics. Through the MOU, we expect to build a global partnership with Cambridge and contribute to scientific advancement. Based on this, we also plan to establish a strategic cooperation platform with universities possessing leading quantum science technologies, such as the University of Waterloo in Canada and the Cleveland Clinic in the United States.\\n-Why 'quantum mechanics'?\\n\\u25b2Quantum science and technology is an innovative tool that can solve complex problems humanity faces, such as cryptography, optimization problems, new drug development, and artificial intelligence. It is a core technology driving sustainable development in future society, a force reshaping the global industrial landscape, and at the center of technological hegemony competition among nations. Yonsei University is strategically fostering quantum science and technology, building an ecosystem with two pillars: education and research. On the education side, we plan to operate a non-degree education program called 'Quantum Academy' that covers everyone from the general public to students and non-majors, aiming to improve quantum literacy across society. To cultivate top-tier talent, we are pushing to establish a Department of Quantum Informatics in graduate school starting this semester.\\nIn research, we are intensifying efforts based on the IBM Quantum System One (Yonsei installed this quantum computer at the Songdo International Campus Quantum Computing Center in November last year, the first in Korea and the second worldwide among universities). We expect to achieve results in various fields such as new drug development, logistics, finance, and basic science. We have adopted the slogan 'Quantum LOVE' (Literacy, Outreach, Versatility, Engagement) and are promoting joint research with world-renowned research institutions. Our goal is to become a global hub for quantum technology cooperation and research.\\n-Please tell us more about the IBM quantum computer Yonsei introduced.\\n\\u25b2The 127-qubit IBM quantum computer we brought in has the most advanced technology and significantly improved error rates. We plan to use it to create a cutting-edge bioindustry complex in Incheon. It can shorten the time and increase the probability of success in new drug development, which traditionally required a long time, very low probability, and a lot of money. This will provide a major growth engine for our society and contribute to enhancing the nation's status. We have not only introduced the equipment but also recruited eight experts to build a talent pool.\\n\\\"The Key to AI Innovation Protecting the Dignified Lives of Citizens is Multidisciplinary Convergent Research\\\"\\n-What will the 'AI Innovation Institute' launching this year do?\\n\\u25b2All colleges of Yonsei University will participate in the institute. It is the largest single AI research institute in Korea, covering diverse fields such as humanities, social sciences, education, medicine, engineering, and business. Beyond technology-centered AI research, we aim to conduct 'multidisciplinary convergent research' exploring the impact of AI on human life and society. In the humanities and social sciences, we will conduct in-depth research on topics like 'AI and social change,' 'AI and human interaction,' and 'AI and security.' The education sector plans to develop AI-based education models. Kia donated over 10 billion KRW. This can be seen as a new industry-academia-research cooperation model laying the foundation for AI and future mobility fields. Another example of multidisciplinary convergent research is the 'Institute for Population and Talent,' jointly established by the medical and business schools. It conducts convergent research addressing social challenges such as low birth rates, aging, immigration, education, labor, mental health, and dignified living. The goal is to propose policy alternatives that ensure everyone, including vulnerable groups, can enjoy a dignified life amid rapidly changing population structures.\\nYoon Dong-seop, President of Yonsei University, is being interviewed by Asia Economy at the Yonsei University Main Building in Sinchon, Seoul. Photo by Jo Yong-jun\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\n\\\"Yonsei's Global Capabilities to Compete with the World, Inheriting the Spirit of Founding Missionaries\\\"\\n-What is Yonsei University's vision as a global academia? Is the 'Songdo Campus era' settling in well?\\n\\u25b2The Residential College system in Songdo is successfully settling in. Since it is a new attempt, the ultimate evaluation will come in 10 years, but it is one of the systems Yonsei can be proud of. Since my inauguration as president, I have been thinking about education unique to the international campus that other universities cannot attempt. Our students can receive education equivalent to that of the US Ivy League in Korea, under much more comfortable conditions. This is thanks to the dedication of our professors.\\nYonsei is expanding strategic partnerships with leading overseas researchers and global research institutions through the Yonsei Frontier Lab. In 2024, we hosted the 'IAMC (Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium) International Conference' for the first time in Korea, solidifying our position as a leading university in climate policy research. This year, we also hosted 'RECOMB-Microbiome 2025,' the world's top conference in computational biology, for the first time in Korea. We plan to translate outstanding faculty research into English and share it with scholars worldwide through the Yonsei News newsletter. We also operate various global education programs aimed at fostering a sense of global community and international leadership beyond borders. The Global Institute of Theology (GIT), operated by the Divinity School, has had 119 students from 32 countries since its establishment in 2015. It exemplifies Yonsei's global educational spirit, inheriting the pioneering spirit of missionary Underwood.\\n-Yonsei University was built through the sweat and blood of missionaries including Underwood. Social contribution activities are indispensable.\\n\\u25b2Based on the founding ideology of Christian spirit, contributing to society through education and research is our important mission. We are actively expanding research and education programs to implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among them, the Institute for Global Engagement and Empowerment (IGEE) collaborates with various international organizations including the UN to promote innovative projects for sustainable development. We also co-host the Global Sustainable Development Forum (GEEF) with the Ban Ki-moon Foundation, providing a platform for global discussions. Last year, together with Korea University, Seoul National University, and Pohang University of Science and Technology, we pledged to strengthen social responsibility through the 'Sustainable Campus Initiative' joint declaration and held a forum. Yonsei Medical Center builds medical education systems, provides medical volunteer services, and conducts research for developing countries, sharing advanced medical technology and infrastructure worldwide.\\n\\\"140th Anniversary of Yonsei... Leap to a World-Class Research University through Student-Centered Educational Innovation\\\"\\n-Yonsei will soon celebrate its 140th anniversary. What about the next 10 years?\\n\\u25b2Western missionaries with a great vision founded Yonsei University in Joseon, which had nothing, and nurtured South Korea's competitiveness. Just as they lifted us up, Yonsei must contribute through education so that lands like Joseon back then, now third-world countries, can prosper 10 or 100 years from now. Looking at the next 10 years briefly, we plan to select doctors from remote areas in Africa, train them at Severance Hospital, and prepare projects so they can return to their countries and serve their people. Also, it is necessary to solve humanity's challenges and contribute to social development through convergent research. From this perspective, our university's proud humanities, engineering, and world-class hospital provide optimal research conditions.\\n-You emphasized the 'Yonsei spirit' at your inauguration and promoted 'Empowering Yonsei.'\\n\\u25b2Over the past year, we have worked to translate the Yonsei spirit into concrete achievements, and I believe that identity has become clearer. We have laid the foundation for Yonsei to establish itself as a center of knowledge creation by building interdisciplinary convergence and future technology-leading research infrastructure such as the AI Innovation Institute, Yonsei Quantum Complex, and Biomedical Engineering Convergence Research Center. Yonsei's education is transforming into a true empowering space through systematizing AI and software basic education, AI convergence advanced majors, student-designed majors, and strengthening global social responsibility education. Above all, the depth, dignity, and cultural-humanistic foundation of Yonsei people, demonstrated by alumnus Han Kang winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, reaffirm that our university is not merely a technology or performance-centered institution but a value-centered university for people and society.\\n-Please tell us about your future goals and attempts at change.\\n\\u25b2To change, we must accurately diagnose problems. I will consider this carefully. Now, just over a year into my term, I can say for sure that the education system will move toward research-centered and graduate school-centered. In that process, students must be able to design their own majors autonomously. As part of this, about 260 students will enter next year through student-designed majors. The university must lead well. By the end of my term, I will build a foundation for Yonsei to leap into a world-class research university. I will focus on expanding infrastructure for research and innovation and achieve student-centered educational innovation. I will communicate with faculty, students, staff, and alumni to explore development directions to create an open university where all members feel pride and trust. Lastly, I will take the lead in realizing publicness and social value aligned with Yonsei University's founding spirit, including support for vulnerable groups.\\nInterview by Lee Myung-jin, Head of Social Affairs Department\\nCompiled by Choi Young-chan, Reporter\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\nHot Picks Today\\n\\\"Cash-Rich Seniors Arrive After Watching TV\\\"......\\n\\ub9c8\\uc2a4\\ud06c\\uc601\\uc5ed\\nDan Ives Visits Korea: \\\"SK Hynix Could Double... 3 Challenges for K-Tech Stocks\\\"\\n\\\"Flying from Incheon to Paris...

Yoon was named president among a total of five recommended candidates in the election that began in October, 2023. He is the first president in 12 years to have been elected from the College of Medicine, making him the fifth president from the college overall. With a long resume of experience in key positions, most notably the president and CEO of the Yonsei University Health System (YUHS), Yoon is decidedly a proven leader. Dividing his vision into four categories\\u2014governance, education, research, and finance\\u2014Yoon has devised strategies aimed to welcome a brighter future for all members of Yonsei.\\nThe Yonsei Annals\\nexplores Yoon\\u2019s background and commitments.\\nCONTRIBUTED BY YONSEI UNIVERSITY PUBLIC RELATIONS TEAM\\nWelcoming a new president\\nAs a leader of the university, the president is in charge of overseeing various aspects, including administrative affairs, finances, the educational system, and overall management. Not only is he in control of internal affairs, but he exerts substantial external authority as well. Embracing the essence of a presidential system, Yonsei University has welcomed a total of 19 presidents in the past, each with notable contributions to the school\\u2019s academic legitimacy and rich legacy.\\nPresidential candidates go through four evaluation stages: candidate invitation, candidate selection, policy evaluation, and nomination. Out of the willing candidates, four or five are selected by the President Candidate Recommendation Committee. Then, the Committee of Professors conducts a policy announcement event and a policy debate, which is immediately followed by a vote from the evaluation group. This determines the three final candidates, whose names are submitted to the Board of Directors. Through a deliberative process by the Board of Directors, Professor Yoon was finalized as the 20th president of Yonsei University on Oct. 25, 2023.\\nYoon commenced his four-year term at the inauguration ceremony, which took place in the Concert Hall of Centennial Hall at 11 a.m., February 1st. Numerous attendees, including Heo Dong-soo, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Kim Jin-pyo, Speaker of the National Assembly of South Korea, Ban Ki-moon, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, and Lee Kyoung-ryul, President of the Yonsei Alumni Association, participated in the event. The program consisted of an appointment speech by Heo, succeeded by a question-and-answer session on the president\\u2019s pledges. After that, President Yoon swore an oath and gave an inauguration speech, which was followed by congratulatory addresses from the participants.\\nA proven educator and leader\\nBorn in 1961, Yoon graduated Gyeongnam High School, then obtained both a bachelor\\u2019s and master\\u2019s degree in medicine from Yonsei University. In 1999, he began his career as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery at Yonsei\\u2019s College of Medicine, and obtained a Doctorate of Medicine from Korea University in 2003. After this, he returned to Yonsei as an Associate Professor, and became a full professor in 2008. He is known for having expertise in treating pancreatic cancer, and in 2006, was awarded the Best Clinical Instruction Award[1].\\nYoon is also a renowned leader with multiple previous roles in the medical community. Starting from his internship in 1987, Yoon\\u2019s journey led him to becoming the 13th director of Gangnam Severance Hospital in 2018, marking almost three decades of service[2]. It was during this period that he started his career in hospital administration by taking the roles of Deputy Director of the Emergency Care Center and several key positions in the QI (Quality Improvement) Office. Since August, 2020, he has served as the president of the YUHS and the Senior Vice President for Medical Affairs. Under his leadership, both Gangnam Severance and the Yonsei University College of Medicine witnessed a sequence of notable achievements. Gangnam Severance successfully earned its highest profits with the annual operating revenue reaching \\u20a9400 billion, while Yonsei\\u2019s College of Medicine ranked first in the country and 32nd worldwide[2]. Such accomplishments are notable considering the challenges posed by the global outbreak of COVID-19. In May and September of 2022, Yoon was appointed President of the Korean Hospital Association (KHA) and the Korean Medical Education Council, respectively. Such a background highlights his reputation as an academic leader and representative in the medical field.\\nOpening a window to the future\\nPresident Yoon has emphasized the importance of \\u201c\\uc5f0\\uc138\\ub2e4\\uc6c0\\u201d (\\nYon sei da um\\n), which translates to \\\"Yonseiness,\\\" throughout his election campaign. Yoon has stated that Yonseiness embodies \\u201cgovernance centered on respect and communication,\\u201d serving as a guiding principle for Yonsei as it navigates the crossroads of crisis and opportunity[3]. Yoon\\u2019s main pledges are divided into four sections: governance, education, research, and finance, each based on the value of \\u201cEmpowering Yonsei.\\u201d\\nGovernance is focused on innovating the administrative system and improving faculty salaries to suitable levels. For education, Yoon has devised a \\u201cSelf-Designed Semester System,\\u201d where students can choose one semester before graduation to dive into various areas of study. During this semester, students will choose from a variety of minor, double major, micro major, and interdisciplinary major classes as well as discuss their self-designed curriculum with professors through a mentorship system. As for research, Yoon emphasizes transdisciplinary practices to enhance global research competitiveness. He aims to achieve this through progressively implementing a full tuition support policy for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) graduate students. In terms of finance, Yoon will focus on diversifying financial income. Aiming to expand intensive funding and introduce new fundraising systems, he plans on increasing profits as well as financial stability.\\n* \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 * \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 *\\n\\u201cOur university is no longer a domestic university. We are now growing towards becoming a global top 30 university, and this is no longer a level that can be developed by forcing anything[3],\\u201d Yoon stressed in an interview. As a leader of an expanding, influential institution, Yoon has undertaken the important assignment of empowering Yonseians and pushing the school forward. Through ambitious pledges and a strong commitment to \\u201cYonseiness,\\u201d Yoon has continuously expressed aspirations for making Yonsei a leading university. With the commencement of his presidency, all Yonseians eagerly await a brighter future defined by the academic brilliance and global impact that Yonsei has always upheld.\\n[1] Yoon Dong-sup\\u2019s development plan\\n[2]\\nThe Monthly Chosun\\n[3] Yonsei University\\n\\ud0a4\\uc6cc\\ub4dc\\n#New_President_of_Yonsei\\n#Professor_Yoon_Dong_sup\\n#Empowering_Yonsei\\n#Inauguration\\nLee Han-gyoul\\nstlee0329@yonsei.ac.kr\\n\\ub2e4\\ub978\\uae30\\uc0ac \\ubcf4\\uae30\\n\\uc800\\uc791\\uad8c\\uc790 \\u00a9 The Yonsei Annals \\ubb34\\ub2e8\\uc804\\uc7ac \\ubc0f \\uc7ac\\ubc30\\ud3ec \\uae08\\uc9c0\\n\\ub313\\uae00\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\n\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\ud55c \\ub313\\uae00\\uc740 \\ub2e4\\uc2dc \\ubcf5\\uad6c\\ud560 \\uc218 \\uc5c6\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.\\n\\uadf8\\ub798\\ub3c4 \\uc0ad\\uc81c\\ud558\\uc2dc\\uaca0\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\uae4c?\\n\\ube44\\ubc00\\ubc88\\ud638\\n\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\n\\ub2eb\\uae30\\nComments\\n0\\n\\ub313\\uae00 \\uc811\\uae30\\nPlease log-in to leave comments.\\n\\ub313\\uae00 \\ub0b4\\uc6a9\\uc785\\ub825\\n0\\n/ 400\\n\\ube44\\ud68c\\uc6d0 \\ub85c\\uadf8\\uc778\\n\\uc774\\ub984\\n\\ube44\\ubc00\\ubc88\\ud638\\n\\ub313\\uae00 \\ub0b4\\uc6a9\\uc785\\ub825\\n0\\n/ 400\\n\\ub4f1\\ub85d\\n\\ub313\\uae00\\uc4f0\\uae30\\n\\uacc4\\uc815\\uc744 \\uc120\\ud0dd\\ud558\\uc2dc\\uba74 \\ub85c\\uadf8\\uc778\\u00b7\\uacc4\\uc815\\uc778\\uc99d\\uc744 \\ud1b5\\ud574\\n\\ub313\\uae00\\uc744 \\ub0a8\\uae30\\uc2e4 \\uc218 \\uc788\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.\\n\\ud68c\\uc6d0 \\ub85c\\uadf8\\uc778\\n\\ube44\\ud68c\\uc6d0 \\uae00\\uc4f0\\uae30\\n\\uc774\\ub984\\n\\ube44\\ubc00\\ubc88\\ud638\\n\\uc790\\ub3d9\\ub4f1\\ub85d\\ubc29\\uc9c0\\n\\ud655\\uc778\\n\\ucde8\\uc18c\\n\\ub85c\\uadf8\\uc778 \\uc635\\uc158 \\ucc3d\\ub2eb\\uae30\\nOther articles\\nSouth Korea\\u2019s 2025 Crisis: Lessons from 1997\\nA Glass Half Full and Empty\\nThe Winner Takes It All\\nThe Death of Humanities\\nThrough the Eyes of Memory\\nThe Truth for Sale\\nThe Evolution of Student Activism in South Korea\\nBranches of the Same Root, Blossoms of the Same Branch\\nThe Heart of Yonsei Soccer\\nThe Rise, Rejection, and Reimagining of Korea\\u2019s Cafe Study Scene\\nC\\nO\\nNTACT US\\nSubscribe\\nannals@yonsei.ac.kr\\nfacebook\\ninstagram\\nyoutube\\nABOUT US\\nAbout Us\\nOur Organization\\nLocation\\nGUIDE DESK\\nSubscribe to Annals\\nAdvertise with Us\\nComplaints\\nLetters to the Editor\\nCopyright Contract\\n\\uae30\\uc0ac\\uac80\\uc0c9\\nThe Yonsei Annals, Student Union Building G106, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Korea | TEL 02-2123-3372\\nJuvenile Protection Supervisor : Kwon Do-in\\n\\uc704\\ub85c\\n\\uc804\\uccb4\\uba54\\ub274\\nAll Articles\\nCover Story\\nAll Articles\\nCover Story\\nCampus Reporting\\nAll Articles\\nPhoto Briefing\\nCampus Issue\\nWallposter\\nCampus Insider\\nCulture\\nAll Articles\\nCulture\\nReview\\nIt-selection\\nCurrent Issues\\nAll Articles\\nToday's Affairs\\nSociety\\nWorldwide\\nPhoto\\nAll Articles\\nPhoto Essay\\nFocus\\nAround Us\\nRegular Features\\nAll Articles\\nSpecial Report\\nTake a Break\\nPeople/Yonseian\\nVoice on Campus\\nBehind the Scenes\\nTravel Diary\\nEnquete\\nOpinion\\nLightbulb\\nFree Column\\nDiscontinued Columns\\nAll Articles\\nEditor's Pick\\nCourse Link\\nGlobal Agora\\nGlobal Forum\\nGlobal Insight\\nGlobal Spotlight\\nGuideline\\nInternational\\nInternational Eyecatcher\\nMinority Report\\nSocial Scope\\nYour Controversy\\nCover Story--Special Report\\nCampus Reporting--Briefing\\nCampus Reporting--Campus Detective\\nWorld Affairs--Hidden Voices\\nWorld Affairs--Global Connection\\nCulture--Artrepreneur\\nRegular Features--Time Capsule\\nRegular Features--Your Bookshelf\\nRegular Features--The Yonsei Annals & Aon Hewitt\\nRegular Features--Chief\\u2019s Column\\nRegular Features--The Annals Board\\nSocial Affairs\\nInternational\\nSurvey\\nRC Special\\nReporter's Pick\\nEnquete\\nNewsfeed\\nVideo\\nAll Articles\\nKnow More\\nRating Seoul\\nKoReacts\\nTalk to Me in Korean\\nY-vlogs\\n\\uc804\\uccb4\\uba54\\ub274\\ub2eb\\uae30\"}"}], "step_13": [{"role": "assistant", "content": [{"search_engine_query": "{\"keywords\":\"Yoon Dong-seop biography\",\"max_results\":5}"}]}, {"role": "handler_log", "content": "Successfully decoded model response.", "model_response_decoded": ["search_engine_query(keywords='Yoon Dong-seop biography',max_results=5)"]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "[{'title': 'The New President of Yonsei < Cover Story < Cover Story < \uae30\uc0ac\ubcf8\ubb38 - The ...', 'href': 'http://annals.yonsei.ac.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=11162', 'body': 'ON FEBRUARY 1, Professor Yoon Dong-sup was inaugurated as the 20th president of Yonsei University.

Sometimes, it is even called a \\\"friend of reform.\\\" Yoon Dong-seop (63), President of Yonsei University, is a surgeon who skillfully wields that scalpel. As an authority in the deep areas of the human body, particularly in the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas fields, he temporarily put down the scalpel and transformed into the CEO leading Yonsei University in February last year, steering its direction. On March 27, Asia Economy met President Yoon at Underwood Hall, imbued with the 140-year spirit of Yonsei. His eyes sparkled behind his glasses when talking about the \\\"Yonsei spirit\\\" and \\\"Yonsei's future.\\\" The following is a Q&A.\\nYoon Dong-seop, President of Yonsei University, is being interviewed by Asia Economy at the Yonsei University Main Building in Sinchon, Seoul. Photo by Jo Yong-jun\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\n\\\"Leap to a Quantum Research Hub, Elevate South Korea's Status and Secure Future Growth Engines\\\"\\n-I heard you will soon visit the University of Cambridge in the UK.\\n\\u25b2Yonsei University is a world-class university in terms of global capabilities. We have student exchanges and joint research with 740 universities in 77 countries. I will visit not only the UK but also several places such as Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland. At Cambridge, we will sign a joint research MOU on quantum computing, attend an AI conference, and discuss new drug development projects. (On the 3rd, Yonsei signed an MOU with Cambridge to strengthen academic exchange and research cooperation in the field of quantum science and technology.) Cambridge is the cradle of physics research in human history, from Newton's classical mechanics to Stephen Hawking's quantum mechanics. Through the MOU, we expect to build a global partnership with Cambridge and contribute to scientific advancement. Based on this, we also plan to establish a strategic cooperation platform with universities possessing leading quantum science technologies, such as the University of Waterloo in Canada and the Cleveland Clinic in the United States.\\n-Why 'quantum mechanics'?\\n\\u25b2Quantum science and technology is an innovative tool that can solve complex problems humanity faces, such as cryptography, optimization problems, new drug development, and artificial intelligence. It is a core technology driving sustainable development in future society, a force reshaping the global industrial landscape, and at the center of technological hegemony competition among nations. Yonsei University is strategically fostering quantum science and technology, building an ecosystem with two pillars: education and research. On the education side, we plan to operate a non-degree education program called 'Quantum Academy' that covers everyone from the general public to students and non-majors, aiming to improve quantum literacy across society. To cultivate top-tier talent, we are pushing to establish a Department of Quantum Informatics in graduate school starting this semester.\\nIn research, we are intensifying efforts based on the IBM Quantum System One (Yonsei installed this quantum computer at the Songdo International Campus Quantum Computing Center in November last year, the first in Korea and the second worldwide among universities). We expect to achieve results in various fields such as new drug development, logistics, finance, and basic science. We have adopted the slogan 'Quantum LOVE' (Literacy, Outreach, Versatility, Engagement) and are promoting joint research with world-renowned research institutions. Our goal is to become a global hub for quantum technology cooperation and research.\\n-Please tell us more about the IBM quantum computer Yonsei introduced.\\n\\u25b2The 127-qubit IBM quantum computer we brought in has the most advanced technology and significantly improved error rates. We plan to use it to create a cutting-edge bioindustry complex in Incheon. It can shorten the time and increase the probability of success in new drug development, which traditionally required a long time, very low probability, and a lot of money. This will provide a major growth engine for our society and contribute to enhancing the nation's status. We have not only introduced the equipment but also recruited eight experts to build a talent pool.\\n\\\"The Key to AI Innovation Protecting the Dignified Lives of Citizens is Multidisciplinary Convergent Research\\\"\\n-What will the 'AI Innovation Institute' launching this year do?\\n\\u25b2All colleges of Yonsei University will participate in the institute. It is the largest single AI research institute in Korea, covering diverse fields such as humanities, social sciences, education, medicine, engineering, and business. Beyond technology-centered AI research, we aim to conduct 'multidisciplinary convergent research' exploring the impact of AI on human life and society. In the humanities and social sciences, we will conduct in-depth research on topics like 'AI and social change,' 'AI and human interaction,' and 'AI and security.' The education sector plans to develop AI-based education models. Kia donated over 10 billion KRW. This can be seen as a new industry-academia-research cooperation model laying the foundation for AI and future mobility fields. Another example of multidisciplinary convergent research is the 'Institute for Population and Talent,' jointly established by the medical and business schools. It conducts convergent research addressing social challenges such as low birth rates, aging, immigration, education, labor, mental health, and dignified living. The goal is to propose policy alternatives that ensure everyone, including vulnerable groups, can enjoy a dignified life amid rapidly changing population structures.\\nYoon Dong-seop, President of Yonsei University, is being interviewed by Asia Economy at the Yonsei University Main Building in Sinchon, Seoul. Photo by Jo Yong-jun\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\n\\\"Yonsei's Global Capabilities to Compete with the World, Inheriting the Spirit of Founding Missionaries\\\"\\n-What is Yonsei University's vision as a global academia? Is the 'Songdo Campus era' settling in well?\\n\\u25b2The Residential College system in Songdo is successfully settling in. Since it is a new attempt, the ultimate evaluation will come in 10 years, but it is one of the systems Yonsei can be proud of. Since my inauguration as president, I have been thinking about education unique to the international campus that other universities cannot attempt. Our students can receive education equivalent to that of the US Ivy League in Korea, under much more comfortable conditions. This is thanks to the dedication of our professors.\\nYonsei is expanding strategic partnerships with leading overseas researchers and global research institutions through the Yonsei Frontier Lab. In 2024, we hosted the 'IAMC (Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium) International Conference' for the first time in Korea, solidifying our position as a leading university in climate policy research. This year, we also hosted 'RECOMB-Microbiome 2025,' the world's top conference in computational biology, for the first time in Korea. We plan to translate outstanding faculty research into English and share it with scholars worldwide through the Yonsei News newsletter. We also operate various global education programs aimed at fostering a sense of global community and international leadership beyond borders. The Global Institute of Theology (GIT), operated by the Divinity School, has had 119 students from 32 countries since its establishment in 2015. It exemplifies Yonsei's global educational spirit, inheriting the pioneering spirit of missionary Underwood.\\n-Yonsei University was built through the sweat and blood of missionaries including Underwood. Social contribution activities are indispensable.\\n\\u25b2Based on the founding ideology of Christian spirit, contributing to society through education and research is our important mission. We are actively expanding research and education programs to implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among them, the Institute for Global Engagement and Empowerment (IGEE) collaborates with various international organizations including the UN to promote innovative projects for sustainable development. We also co-host the Global Sustainable Development Forum (GEEF) with the Ban Ki-moon Foundation, providing a platform for global discussions. Last year, together with Korea University, Seoul National University, and Pohang University of Science and Technology, we pledged to strengthen social responsibility through the 'Sustainable Campus Initiative' joint declaration and held a forum. Yonsei Medical Center builds medical education systems, provides medical volunteer services, and conducts research for developing countries, sharing advanced medical technology and infrastructure worldwide.\\n\\\"140th Anniversary of Yonsei... Leap to a World-Class Research University through Student-Centered Educational Innovation\\\"\\n-Yonsei will soon celebrate its 140th anniversary. What about the next 10 years?\\n\\u25b2Western missionaries with a great vision founded Yonsei University in Joseon, which had nothing, and nurtured South Korea's competitiveness. Just as they lifted us up, Yonsei must contribute through education so that lands like Joseon back then, now third-world countries, can prosper 10 or 100 years from now. Looking at the next 10 years briefly, we plan to select doctors from remote areas in Africa, train them at Severance Hospital, and prepare projects so they can return to their countries and serve their people. Also, it is necessary to solve humanity's challenges and contribute to social development through convergent research. From this perspective, our university's proud humanities, engineering, and world-class hospital provide optimal research conditions.\\n-You emphasized the 'Yonsei spirit' at your inauguration and promoted 'Empowering Yonsei.'\\n\\u25b2Over the past year, we have worked to translate the Yonsei spirit into concrete achievements, and I believe that identity has become clearer. We have laid the foundation for Yonsei to establish itself as a center of knowledge creation by building interdisciplinary convergence and future technology-leading research infrastructure such as the AI Innovation Institute, Yonsei Quantum Complex, and Biomedical Engineering Convergence Research Center. Yonsei's education is transforming into a true empowering space through systematizing AI and software basic education, AI convergence advanced majors, student-designed majors, and strengthening global social responsibility education. Above all, the depth, dignity, and cultural-humanistic foundation of Yonsei people, demonstrated by alumnus Han Kang winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, reaffirm that our university is not merely a technology or performance-centered institution but a value-centered university for people and society.\\n-Please tell us about your future goals and attempts at change.\\n\\u25b2To change, we must accurately diagnose problems. I will consider this carefully. Now, just over a year into my term, I can say for sure that the education system will move toward research-centered and graduate school-centered. In that process, students must be able to design their own majors autonomously. As part of this, about 260 students will enter next year through student-designed majors. The university must lead well. By the end of my term, I will build a foundation for Yonsei to leap into a world-class research university. I will focus on expanding infrastructure for research and innovation and achieve student-centered educational innovation. I will communicate with faculty, students, staff, and alumni to explore development directions to create an open university where all members feel pride and trust. Lastly, I will take the lead in realizing publicness and social value aligned with Yonsei University's founding spirit, including support for vulnerable groups.\\nInterview by Lee Myung-jin, Head of Social Affairs Department\\nCompiled by Choi Young-chan, Reporter\\n\\uc6d0\\ubcf8\\ubcf4\\uae30 \\uc544\\uc774\\ucf58\\nHot Picks Today\\n\\\"Cash-Rich Seniors Arrive After Watching TV\\\"......\\n\\ub9c8\\uc2a4\\ud06c\\uc601\\uc5ed\\nDan Ives Visits Korea: \\\"SK Hynix Could Double... 3 Challenges for K-Tech Stocks\\\"\\n\\\"Flying from Incheon to Paris...

They include Ko Byung-gan, Lee Woo-joo, Kim Byung-soo, and Kim Han-joong.\\nWith Yoon's appointment as the new president, he will become the fifth president with a medical school background.\\nYoon built his slogan, \\u201cA New Yonsei Era, Opening a Window to the Future,\\\" on core values that include Yonsei's commitment to the community and humanity through stewardship based on Christian founding ideals, leading the current era through restoring the self-esteem of Yonsei people and embracing the future through interdisciplinary education and research.\\nIn line with this vision, Yoon aims to innovate university governance through empowerment, foster creative talents through innovative education roadmaps, ensure global research competitiveness through transdisciplinary research, maintain financial stability through diversified revenues, enhance community welfare, and promote networking on both domestic and international fronts.\\nFurthermore, he has pledged to strengthen YUHS by supporting world-leading medical research, presenting a blueprint for the future of the medical school, expanding educational and research facilities for the dental school, offering policy support for the nursing school's development, and promoting new hospital initiatives.\\nAdditionally, Yoon plans to provide administrative support for Wonju YHUS, which includes Wonju Severance Christian Hospital and Yonsei University College of Medicine Wonju Campus in Gangwon Province, through expansion and improvement projects.\\n\\\"What Yonsei needs now is empowerment,\\u201d Yoon said in his development plan for Yonsei University. \\\"We aim to reinvigorate a culture of shared responsibility by granting each institution the practical authority it rightfully deserves.\\\"\\nYoon is a surgical specialist who graduated from Yonsei University College of Medicine.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.

It is located near the state\\u2019s border with\\nConnecticut\\nand has a surface area of 1,442 acres (2.253\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Since 1921, the lake has also been known by a much longer name having 45 letters comprising fourteen syllables:\\nLake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\n. The lake has become famous beyond\\nCentral Massachusetts\\nfor having the longest name of any geographic feature in all of the United States.\\nName\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe lake's name comes from the\\nAlgonquian\\nlanguage\\nof the\\nNipmuc\\nand is often said to mean, \\\"Fishing Place at the Boundaries\\u2014Neutral Meeting Grounds\\\".\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nA more fitting translation is \\\"lake divided by islands\\\", according to anthropologist\\nIves Goddard\\n.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nToday, \\\"Webster Lake\\\" may be the name most used, but some (including many residents of Webster) take pride in reeling off the longer versions.  This lake has several alternative names. Lake Chaubunagungamaug is the name of the lake as recognized by the\\nU.S. Department of the Interior\\n,\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nand is the name appearing in the earliest local records.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAlgonquian\\n-speaking people had several different names for the lake as recorded on old maps and historical records. However, all of these were similar in part and had almost the same translation. Among other early names were \\\"Chabanaguncamogue\\\" and \\\"Chaubanagogum\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nEarly town records show the name as \\\"Chabunagungamaug Pond\\\", which was also the name of the local\\nNipmuc\\ntown (recorded in 1668 and 1674 with somewhat different spellings). This has been translated as \\\"boundary fishing place\\\",\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nbut something close to \\\"fishing place at the boundary\\\" or \\\"that which is a divided island lake\\\" may be more accurate.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nA 1795 map of Massachusetts indicated the name, using the long form's first eight syllables, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA survey of the lake done in 1830 lists the name as \\\"Chaubunagungamaugg\\\", the six-syllable older name. The following year, both\\nDudley\\nand\\nOxford\\n, which then adjoined the lake, filed maps listing the lake by its eight-syllable form, as \\\"Chargoggagoggmanchoggagogg\\\".\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nAnthropologist Ives Goddard considers that 1831 name to be a cartographer's creation that corrupted the actual name while confusing this lake with nearby Manchaug Pond.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nLong name\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe exaggerated name \\\"Lake Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg\\\" (\\n/\\n\\u02cc\\nl\\ne\\u026a\\nk\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259r\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\n\\u02cc\\nm\\n\\u00e6\\nn\\n\\u02c8\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0252\\n\\u0261\\nt\\u0283\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02cc\\nb\\n\\u028c\\nn\\n\\u0259\\n\\u02c8\\n\\u0261\\n\\u028c\\n\\u014b\\n\\u0261\\n\\u0259\\nm\\n\\u0254\\u02d0\\n\\u0261\\n/\\n)\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nis a 45-letter alternative name for this body of fresh water, often cited as the longest\\nplace name\\nin the\\nUnited States\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nand one of the longest in the world.  Many area residents and the official website of the town of Webster consider the longer version correct.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nPatch using longer name of lake\\nThe humorous translation is: \\\"You fish on your side, I'll fish on my side, and no one shall fish in the middle\\\".  Its humorous translation was perhaps invented by Laurence J. Daly, editor of\\nThe Webster Times\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nAccording to Ives Goddard, Curator of Anthropology at the\\nSmithsonian Institution\\n, Daly created this \\\"monstrosity\\\" around 1921, though this is probably not correct, as the name was in use as early as\\nc.\\n1910\\non postcards.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nThe lakeside\\nSpellings of the long name vary; in 2009, following six years of press reports, the local Chamber of Commerce agreed to have the spelling changed on its signs, but a 45-letter version of the name arrayed in a semicircle is still used.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nWebster public schools use one long form of the name in various capacities.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nGeography\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOblique view of Lake Chaubunagungamaug in 1974\\nWebster Lake is a 1,442-acre (5.84\\u00a0km\\n2\\n)\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nlake with a 17-mile (27\\u00a0km) shoreline in southern Massachusetts, near the Connecticut border. It is the fourth largest fresh body of water in Massachusetts, after slightly larger\\nLong Pond\\n, The\\nWachusett Reservoir\\nin Clinton, and the much larger\\nQuabbin Reservoir\\n. The average depth is 13 feet (4.0\\u00a0m) and the maximum depth is 49 feet (15\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nAlthough the lake is natural in origin, its outlet has a dam that raises the water level by roughly 2 feet (0.61\\u00a0m).\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe dam initially provided water for a mill, and subsequently, the water rights to the lake were owned by Cranston Print Works; currently, the dam is owned by Webster Lake Preservation LLC.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe lake is commonly divided into three smaller bodies of water: North Pond, Middle Pond, and South Pond. Narrow channels connect them.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIslands\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has about 7\\u20138 islands. Some have houses and are habitable; a few are extremely small and uninhabitable. They include:\\nLong Island: The largest island in Webster Lake. It has many homes, electric power lines, underground/underwater municipal water and sewer service, and several fire hydrants. It is in the Middle Pond.\\nGoat Island is the second largest island. It has a few homes and boats. It is in the Middle Pond but isolated from the cluster of islands that includes Long Island.\\nWell Island: A smaller island with one house west of Long Island in the Middle Pond.\\nStrip Island: Generally northeast of Long Island and north of Cobble Island, with one house in the Middle Pond.\\nCobble Island: East of Long Island, in the Middle Pond.\\nLittle Island: In South Pond, right out of the no wake zone from the Middle Pond, one house.\\nBirch Island: Large island on the west edge of Middle Pond with Pout Pond on the west side and swamp surrounding the entire island.  It is located roughly between Treasure Island and The Narrows and has access by a bridge on Birch Island Road near The Narrows. Many homes are on the island, and an establishment once called Birch Island Pavilion is now called Waterfront Mary's.\\nMisery Island is a small island near the east side of Narrows in Middle Pond. May be called either Misery Island or Skunk Island, depending on the map.\\nMarinas\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nWebster Lake has two marinas:\\nLakeview Marine: The only full-service marine store and service shop on Webster Lake.\\nPoint Breeze: A restaurant with a small marina. Point Breeze Marina has the only dockside gas pump on the lake.\\nIn popular culture\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 1950s, a plan to shorten the official name of the lake inspired a poem of\\ndoggerel\\nverse which concludes:\\n\\\"Touch not a g!\\\" No impious hand\\nShall wrest one from that noble name\\nFifteen in all their glory stand\\nAnd ever shall the same.\\nFor never shall that number down,\\nTho\\nGogg and Magogg\\nshout and thunder;\\nChar\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg's renown\\nShall blaze, the beacon of the town,\\nWhile nations gaze and wonder.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThree songs about the lake's name have been written. The first was a regional song from the 1930s. The second, \\\"The Lake Song (Char\\u00adgogg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adman\\u00adchaugg\\u00ada\\u00adgogg\\u00adchau\\u00adbun\\u00ada\\u00adgung\\u00ada\\u00admaugg)\\\", was recorded by\\nEthel Merman\\nand\\nRay Bolger\\nand released in 1954 by\\nDecca\\n. It presents Daly's fake translation as a Native American tradition, and includes a spoken section in which the singers take on heavily caricatured accents. The most recent was released in 2010 by\\nDiane Taraz\\n.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nList of long place names\\nLongest word in English\\nTaumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu\\n, the longest place name in New Zealand, and the world\\nLlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch\\n, the longest place name in the UK\\nLongest words\\nChaubunagungamaug Nipmuck\\nChaubunagungamaug Reservation\\nPolysynthetic language\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\na\\nb\\nPatenaude, Ed (June 28, 2001).\\n\\\"Fabrication leaves us gasping - Old twist to name of lake comes to light\\\"\\n.\\nWorcester Telegram & Gazette\\n.
